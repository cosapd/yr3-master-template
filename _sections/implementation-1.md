<h4>Plan Purpose</h4>
  <p>This Plan proposes a medium-term vision, recommendations, and strategies for improving and developing the Template Area Regional Center over the next ten years. The Plan is an implementation component of the City of San Antonio’s SA Tomorrow Comprehensive Plan. Adopted in 2016, the Comprehensive Plan is the City’s long-range land use and policy plan that is intended to be a blueprint for future growth and development through the year 2040. The Template Area Regional Center Plan is an implementation-oriented Sub-Area plan that will further develop recommendations from the SA Tomorrow Comprehensive Plan to improve quality of life for San Antonio residents, guide growth and development that accommodates projected housing and employment increases, and to fulfill other Comprehensive Plan goals and policies through a community-based planning process.</p>
  <p>The Regional Center Plan honors and integrates previously adopted neighborhood and community plans while providing an equitable path for all neighborhoods to participate in planning, to create priorities, and to advocate for implementing their priorities in the future.</p>

  <h4>Intent of the Plan</h4>
  <p>The Template Area Regional Center Plan will be the essential tool to guide future development and City investment in the plan area based on the vision and goals [insert hyperlink] for the Template Area. A diverse assemblage of stakeholders met for a series of nine planning team meetings over 15 months to make recommendations that support both the policy direction of the Comprehensive Plan as well as the community’s aspirations. This work culminated with achievable recommendations and strategies that will be utilized by City Departments, partner agencies, private entities, and community partners to guide policies and investments that implement appropriate and desired development patterns as well as the creation and support of livable, complete neighborhoods. </p>

<div>
  <h4>How to Use This Plan</h4>
  <p>The vision for the Template Area Regional Center can be realized through implementation of the Plan Framework, with recommendations and strategies related to the following topics:  Land Use, Focus Areas, Mobility, Amenities and Infrastructure, Housing, and Economic Development. These recommendations and strategies include policy and regulatory matters, partnerships, and investments. Plan recommendations are written to provide actionable specificity while still allowing the flexibility needed to adapt to unforeseen challenges or opportunities.</p>

  <h4>Coordination with Adopted Plans</h4>
  <p>The City of San Antonio adopted several plans in recent decades for individual neighborhoods or parts of the Template Regional Center.  Each of these plans is described in the Template Plan. Some specific recommendations from these plans are directly referenced as complementary to achieving the Template vision and goals. Each of the plans was used as a foundational element for creating the Template Plan. The previously adopted plans include important historical information, policies reflecting the values of participants at the time of their adoption, detailed information and recommendations for specific places and issues such as for a single neighborhood or for Brackenridge Park, and topics not addressed by the Template Plan in the realms of social services, law enforcement, and organizational strategies for neighborhood associations and other organizations that created the plans. These plans include but are not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Government Hill Neighborhood Plan</li>
    <li>Westfort Alliance Neighborhood Plan</li>
    <li>Mahncke Park Neighborhood Plan</li>
    <li>Tobin Hill Neighborhood Plan</li>
    <li>5 Points Neighborhood Plan</li>
    <li>Template Neighborhoods Plan</li>
    <li>Brackenridge Park Master Plan</li>
    <li>Template Brackenridge Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone(TIRZ) Plan</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Template Plan was also developed to complement and contribute in particular to the implementation of the following regional and citywide plans:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>San Antonio’s Housing Policy Framework</li>
    <li>SA Tomorrow Multi-modal Transportation Plan</li>
    <li>SA Tomorrow Sustainability Plan</li>
    <li>SA Corridors Strategic Framework Plan</li>
    <li>VIA’s Vision 2040 Plan</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In implementing the Template Plan, further consideration should be given to the recommendations of emerging and ongoing planning processes, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>VIA’s Rapid Transit Corridors planning</li>
    <li>SA Climate Ready</li>
    <li>San Antonio’s Housing Policy Framework implementation programs</li>
    <li>San Antonio Parks System Strategic Plan</li>
    <li>San Antonio Sidewalk Master Plan</li>
    <li>ConnectSA</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Statutory Requirements</h4>
  <p>Once adopted by City Council, the Template Area Regional Center Plan becomes a component of the City’s SA Tomorrow Comprehensive Plan. Previously adopted neighborhood, community, and sector land use plans that are contained within or partially overlap the Template Area Regional Center Plan are identified as a foundational part of the Template Area Regional Center Plan. However, where a previous plan and the Template Area Regional Center Plan have conflicting land use designations within the adopted boundary of the Template Area Regional Center Plan, the Sub-Area Plan will be the plan of reference. Similarly, where a previous plan and the Template Area Regional Center Plan have conflicting policies or priorities within the adopted boundary of the Template Area Regional Center Plan, the Sub-Area Plan will be City policy.</p>
  <p>By virtue of the plan adoption process, all proposed projects must be found to be consistent with the SA Tomorrow Comprehensive Plan, and as such, the Template Area Regional Center Plan must be consulted when proposing a public investment or a land use project that requires deviation from current entitlements.</p>
