<p>A vision statement describes the desired state of a place in the future. With community support, an effective vision can influence decisions and inspire action to move toward that idealized future. Goals further describe the outcomes that will support the realization of the vision. These, in turn, are supported by more specific recommendations and strategies that will implement the bigger-picture vision and goals. These strategies will involve specific proposed projects, programs, policies, and other means of achieving the community vision.</p>
<p>The {{ site.subarea-name }} Community Area Vision and Goals were developed with input from residents and community stakeholders through an iterative process of developing and refining these concepts. During preliminary community engagement efforts, community members articulated important values and identified the Eastside Community Area&rsquo;s assets, challenges, and opportunities. This community input became the basis for the Eastside Community Area&rsquo;s Vision and Goals, which were refined with feedback from the Planning Team and participants at a second Community Meeting.</p>
