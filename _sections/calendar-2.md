      <ul>
      <li>You are invited to any of three community meetings and open houses to tell us your thoughts, meet other people from the area, and learn about other people's perspectives.</li>
      <li>Meetings aren't for everyone, so  we will periodically set up stations in busy places for a few hours at time where we will interact with people who can share a few minutes with us before moving on with their day.  We hope to see you out in the community some day at one of these ""intercepts."</li>
      <li>We will use brief surveys and post meeting materials on this webpage, and also announce meetings and intercept locations on the webpage, social media accounts, and through our email list.</li>
      <li>These are in addition to all of the personal interviews, focus groups, and neighborhood meeting visits that we will do.</li>
