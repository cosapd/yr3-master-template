          these station areas will require consistency with the VIA Urban Design
          Guidelines for Transit Station Areas,
          including:<ul><li><strong>Density - </strong> Increased neighborhood
          amenities and destinations near stations and stops influence the type
          of transit services offered in an area. Transit frequency is directly
          dependent on density – the more people and jobs within an area, the
          more transit frequency is justified.</li><li><strong>Design  -
          </strong>Buildings designed for the pedestrian; placed and oriented
          along the front of the street with parking on-street, placed behind or
          structured, and with direct access to first floor building activities
          are vital components of transit-supportive design.</li><li><strong>Mix
          of Uses - </strong>Providing a mix of residential, employment, and
          retail uses within walking distance of a transit stop or transit
          station is beneficial to the community and make walking and riding
          transit more efficient choices for meeting daily
          needs.</li><li><strong>Walkability - </strong>Pleasantly designed,
          walkable places are attractive areas where people desire to travel on
          foot or by mobility device. Active streets that have development that
          is continuous along many blocks encourages economic activity.
          Investments to improve the pedestrian realm include streetscape
          enhancements in public spaces, such as continuous level surfaces,
          street furniture, lighting, landscaping, and shading devices, where
          applicable.</li></ul>

          Pocket parks and plazas should be developed amidst areas with a
          diverse mix of uses, transit service, and density to support their use
          at most times of day. Given anticipated population and employment
          growth, reprogramming existing park spaces and creating new park
          spaces may be needed to serve the population. The north Broadway focus
          area, McCullough and Main Avenues between Cypress and I-35, San Pedro
          Avenue near Cypress Street or Evergreen Street, and Fredericksburg
          Road would all be appropriate places to include plazas for gathering
          and interaction as more people live, work and play in Template. Urban
          plazas in Mexico and other Latin American countries should be
          considered sources of inspiration for plaza design, and for
          understanding the complementary built environments, land uses, and
          densities that support successful and vibrant public plazas.

          Decorative lighting and other pedestrian treatments should be used to
          encourage pedestrian connections across I-35, I-10, and US. 281.
          However, more than lighting and art are needed to make highway
          underpasses feel comfortable, safe, and secure. Consistent with the
          future land use map, dense mixed-development that serves a variety of
          users at all times of day will support an abundance of pedestrians and
          ground floor users. An abundance of fellow pedestrians can make
          underpasses feel more secure, and an enticing street scene on either
          side of a highway can draw people to cross from one side to the other.
          The San Antonio River Walk crossing under I-35 and Pearl Parkway
          crossing under US 281 are two local examples where a combination of
          landscaping, lighting, art, and fresh paint on concrete columns
          coupled with high density mixed development generating significant
          pedestrian traffic have combined to make a highway underpass a more
          tolerable environment to walk through. Notably, in the case of Pearl
          Parkway, most landscaping and other improvements were made next to the
          highway rather than under it.
