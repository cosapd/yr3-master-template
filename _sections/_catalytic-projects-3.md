<p>The San Pedro gateway site is comprised of two blocks straddling San Pedro Avenue, north of I-35. The current mix of uses includes a new gas station convenience store, drive through dining, gas station, legal firm, a bar, and residential. At the time of the digital design charrette conducted for this site, the block on the east side of San Pedro Avenue included a large vacant lot. Since then, the property was sold and the gas station convenience store was constructed. There is a historic landmark building on the eastern block.</p>

<div class="col-12">
<p>Both blocks present interesting design challenges. The block west of San Pedro Avenue is narrow, which would make it difficult to include a primary use serving many people, along with parking, in a format that is pedestrian-friendly and sensitive to properties across the street primarily zoned for multifamily housing in 5 Points Neighborhood. Mexican Americans or Hispanics represent greater than average majorities in the residential areas surrounding this site (typically 70% to 95% on any given block).</p>

<h4>Vision for San Pedro Gateway</h4>
<p>The vision for San Pedro Gateway is to support {{ site.subarea-name }}&rsquo;s need for more housing in areas with transportation choices and opportunity, in a design that reflects some historical building forms from the surrounding area. As discussed in other plan sections, not all blocks on all mixed-use corridors will be able to support a successful concentration of retail businesses, and not all properties in areas designated in the future land use map for high density need to have the highest density and largest buildings.</p>

<p>The vision for San Pedro Gateway reflects these realities, primarily offering housing for people that would want to stay in this area in both multifamily and townhome formats, while contributing to a population base that can support a high quality transit station and concentrations of retail businesses a few blocks away adjacent to San Pedro Avenue between Poplar and Evergreen Streets. The vision includes street facing uses on almost all portions of the site, primarily oriented to San Pedro Avenue. Design principles for each block also include housing that faces Howard Street and Jackson Street, avoiding blank walls, exposed parking structures, and expansive service and delivery areas facing existing and potential future residential uses across those streets.</p>
<p>The concept for the lot between San Pedro Avenue and Jackson Street demonstrates how structured parking can be fit on the interior of a narrow lot, and that new development adjacent to San Pedro Avenue should not turn its back to the neighborhood or relegate Jackson Street to being a place with less people and fewer eyes on the street. Finally, the concept illustrates how new development in this area on the west side of San Pedro should be less dense and smaller scaled than new development on the east side of San Pedro, offering a reasonable transition to the 5 Points neighborhood.</p>
<p>The concept buildings are large, but are comprised of smaller parts that vary within a single block. Some of these parts mimic the proportions of historic two story residential buildings in 5 Points and Tobin Hill. The concept simultaneously signals a transition to downtown.</p>

<p>The vision for San Pedro gateway also offered the opportunity to consider what the San Pedro Avenue streetscape could look like in the future. The concept has not been studied for engineering feasibility, and is but one conceivable outcome; however it shows how a combination of wider sidewalks, street trees, and other amenities such as lighting or benches could make San Pedro Avenue a more enjoyable place for area residents to spend time outdoors, or a more enjoyable place to pass through on foot.</p>
<p>Achieving the vision for San Pedro Avenue, and several other mixed-use corridors in {{ site.subarea-name }}, would benefit from Unified Development Code amendments requiring new development to dedicate space for widening sidewalks, along with giving new development credit towards landscaping requirements for street tree planting.</p>
<p>This concept is meant to be responsive to many area residents who have described regularly using San Pedro Avenue on foot, typically to use buses or area restaurants and services. High quality transit service, a transformative street project, and new development paired with improved regulations can make this area work better for them and make it more useful for future generations.</p>
