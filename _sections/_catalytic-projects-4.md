<p>The San Pedro VIA site is much larger than the San Pedro Gateway site, and despite being only several blocks away, presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for the future. Existing uses are primarily related to VIA&rsquo;s bus maintenance, office, and employee parking needs. There is also a gas station, drive through restaurants, and drive through alcohol sales. San Pedro Springs Creek enters the site form the north, flowing above ground before entering an underground facility, then reemerging above ground closer to Fredericksburg Road. Surrounding the site, to the north is San Pedro Springs Park, to the west a collection of single family homes and duplexes, to the south a mix of homes and industrial services, and to the east San Antonio College and a mix of uses that includes a bar, Esperanza Peace and Justice Center, a gas station convenience store and a drive through restaurant, among others.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The site is home to Mexican Americans or Hispanics representing greater than average majorities in the residential areas surrounding this site (typically 70% to 95% on any given block). Existing public art near the Five Points intersection, including the Visi&oacute;n del Futuro mural, &ldquo;Guardians of Five Points&rdquo; sculptors, and native landscaping are a few examples of how public projects can effectively reflect local culture and landscapes.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>VIA is considering offering higher quality transit service in the future on San Pedro Avenue, Cypress Street, and Fredericksburg Road, and may include a high quality transit station at the intersection of San Pedro Avenue and Cypress Street, the southeast corner of this catalytic site.</p>
<p>On the site, over 500 transit vehicle are washed, maintained, and deployed every day, and hundreds of drivers, office personal, and technicians work to keep VIA&rsquo;s transit service running. The areas immediately surrounding San Pedro Springs Creek on the eastern portion of the site are critical to VIA&rsquo;s operations for the foreseeable future. Some of these activities generate noise and light 24 hours per day. Other areas around the site perimeter are more likely to be available for development that supports a more diverse mix of uses within the timeframe of the {{ site.subarea-name }} Regional Center Plan. However, rearranging or relocating any element of VIA&rsquo;s operations would be complicated and costly.</p>
<p>The long term vision for this site includes developing the entire site for a mix of uses that includes dwellings for people to live in, high quality public spaces, a continuous creek side trail connecting San Pedro Springs Park with Fredericksburg Road, retail and community services, and high quality transit service on two adjacent sides. Recognizing the importance of VIA&rsquo;s operations and the challenging decisions that would need to be made to accommodate this long term vision for this area, which could likely only occur in a series of phases over decades, the catalytic site concept presented here only addresses portions of the site, primarily around the site perimeter, where redevelopment is more conceivable.</p>

<h4>Vision for San Pedro VIA Site</h4>
<p>The concept presented here would support a vibrant pedestrian streetscape on San Pedro Avenue, with a mix of uses that would generate foot track at varying times of day. Such a mix would include housing in diverse formats for diverse users, some ground floor retail and dining opportunities, a priority community use such as a senior center, and some priority retail use such as a grocery. Some of the housing should be for low and moderate income households.</p>
<p>A public plaza at the terminus of Evergreen Street would be a focal point and gathering place for the long street segment between Laurel and Myrtle Streets, while also helping to define a connection to the vibrant street scene at Main Avenue and Evergreen Street a few blocks to the east.</p>

<div class="col-12">
<p>Offices and classrooms could also be accommodated here. Although San Antonio College has substantial growth opportunity within its existing campus, some future expansion could be absorbed near San Pedro Avenue. Complementary education opportunities could include vocational training linked to VIA fleet maintenance, student housing, or satellite classes for other schools that do not have a presence in the area, such as Texas Tech University. Shared parking facilities to efficiently serve the new users and existing local community users could be accommodated on this site in a way that does not compromise a comfortable and enjoyable environment on San Pedro Avenue.</p>
<p>Turning to the northern perimeter adjacent to Myrtle Street, housing would face and define an edge to San Pedro Springs Park across the street. The lowest intensity uses would be located on Flores, across from existing residential areas. Next to where San Pedro Springs Creek enters the site, new development would be set back from the creek sufficiently to provide for sunlight, trees, and green stormwater infrastructure, but would be partially oriented to the publicly accessible Creekside improvements such as a trail, benches, and light; signaling a potential future when the Creek would be day-lighted and accessible to the public all the way from its springs to the 5 Points neighborhood.</p>
<p>When redeveloping areas near San Pedro Avenue, Cypress Street, or Fredericksburg Road, opportunities to incorporate water features into public spaces should not be missed. San Antonio River Authority has identified potential locations throughout this area where surface water detention facilities could be installed to improve water quality in San Pedro Springs Creek.</p>

<div class="col-12">
<p>The process for developing this concept revealed the importance of design to mitigate noise and light, and to account for VIA&rsquo;s site circulation needs, while offering service and delivery areas for San Pedro-oriented development without compromising the San Pedro Avenue pedestrian environment. Dwellings and their windows could not be oriented to the site&rsquo;s interior where VIA operations would continue. Buildings would have to include features for dampening outdoor noise. Extending Jackson Street north from Laurel Street to Myrtle Street would accommodate some combination of service deliveries, VIA circulation, and potentially a bike route if it would be relevant to the larger bicycle network.</p>
<p>Even if the longer term vision of creek restoration, creek access, and housing for people to live in near Flores Street proves elusive, implementing the primary concept would contribute to multiple {{ site.subarea-name }} goals, supporting access to nature and recreation, high quality transit service, and accommodating many households and jobs in a place of opportunity.</p>
