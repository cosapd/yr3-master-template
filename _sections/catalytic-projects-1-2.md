<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Both of the transformative project concepts for the Template Regional Center Plan are located next to San Pedro Avenue. They each show one scenario of what future development could look like in this area, how it could serve the community and complement the greater vision for improving quality of life in Template.</p>
<p>The locations were selected because of their proximity to local amenities such as Downtown and San Pedro Springs Park, their adjacency to a potential high quality, frequent, and reliable transit service that VIA is considering, and the interesting challenges and opportunities they each present.</p>
