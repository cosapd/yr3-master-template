introduction-title: "Plan Element Framework"
lead-copy: "Previous sections of this Plan have outlined our city’s Background and Vision (Section 1) and the Plan Framework (Section 2). Section 3: Plan Elements, provides an outline and discussion of each of the nine plan elements that make up our Comprehensive Plan."
introduction-content: "Each of these nine elements was guided by a Plan Element Working Group (PEWG) composed of community leaders and representatives of relevant City departments, partner organizations, utilities, colleges and universities, neighborhoods and advocacy groups. 
Although many of these elements are typically found in other cities’ Comprehensive Plans, ours also needed to move beyond the standard to reflect our city’s unique context and history. The inclusion of the Historic Preservation and Cultural Heritage (HPCH) and Military (M) elements do just that. 
The nine elements in our plan are: 
Growth and City Form (GCF)
Transportation and Connectivity (TC)
Housing (H)
Jobs and Economic Competitiveness (JEC)
Community Health and Wellness (CHW)
Public Facilities and Community Safety (PFCS)
Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability (NRES)
Historic Preservation and Cultural Heritage (HPCH)
Military (M)"
  subtitle: "Organization"
  content: "Each of the following nine chapters focuses on one of the elements listed above. The chapter provides an overview of major issues and challenges specific to each element as well as a set of goals and policies to set the direction for how our community will respond to and address the challenges before us.
We begin each chapter with an introduction to the element and proceed by addressing key questions relating to that element’s policies and goals.  Wherever possible, we include examples of case studies that demonstrate best practices that have been proven successful in other urban areas. 
Plan Element Goals and Policies are defined as follows: 
Goals are the broadest statements of the community’s desired long term direction. Goals describe ideal end-state conditions in 2040 that would result if the Plan is successfully implemented. 
Policies are statements that identify the community’s preferred actions in relation to the Plan Element Goals.
Each element’s goals and policies reflect and support the City’s Vision and the key Guiding Principles that characterize the City’s ambitions for the next 25 years."

title: "Growth and City Form"
abbreviation: "GCF"
lead-copy: "San Antonio is the seventh largest city in the country, having surpassed Dallas as the second largest city in Texas in the early 2000s. With an estimated population of 1.44 million, our population and employment growth is expected to continue."
introduction-content: "The Alamo Area Metropolitan Planning Organization forecasts that 1.1 million more people with over a half million jobs and households will locate in Bexar County by 2040. 
The main reason for our continued growth is our existing assets. San Antonio is home to the primary employment centers and economic engines of the greater San Antonio-New Braunfels metropolitan statistical area. We’re a major tourist center, attracting about 25 million leisure visitors every year. We’re business-friendly with an affordable tax environment. The City’s municipally-owned utilities provide affordable, reliable energy and water with innovative approaches to long-term service provision—a draw for many businesses. We combine our business environment with a relatively low cost of living and average home price. And our strong cultural heritage creates a unique sense of place, demonstrated in our historic neighborhoods and our well-known public spaces. Clearly, San Antonio offers a high quality of life that will attract employers and employees.
Growth presents a tremendous opportunity for San Antonio—if we plan for it now. 
Growth will create demand for a range of housing types and locations and generate a variety of jobs requiring a variety of employment sites. Aligning the City’s land use plan—how, where and what we develop—with market demand and consumer and employer preferences will allow us to: expand and diversify housing; preserve existing neighborhoods and natural resources; generate more economic activities; achieve our land use objectives; and help address issues such as affordable housing, income/economic segregation and health and wellness.
The City is proactively addressing the challenges and opportunities of growth. Some of the issues we face include changing demographic trends, effectively utilizing our land supply and development patterns to ensure we develop sustainably and remaining economically competitive so all of our residents may experience and benefit from a high quality of life. 
The Growth and City Form (GCF) goals and policies were developed in response to five key areas of questions about what we would like our city to be in the future."

heading-title: "Strategic Infill"
heading-questions: "Where in the city should higher-intensity growth be directed and encouraged?
Given the decreasing land supply in traditionally high-growth areas (north and northwest), which other areas of the city can sustain additional growth? 
How can the City shift development momentum to areas that traditionally have had limited demand?"
heading-content: "San Antonio has a polycentric economic geography with multiple large concentrations of employment and housing throughout the city (e.g., Downtown, the Medical District, military bases, etc.). These concentrations are largely located along major transportation routes, making living near work easier for many residents. But a polycentric pattern also creates challenges. 
The composition of the economy (mainly based on healthcare, the military, education and tourism) and the dispersed employment nodes have scattered both employment opportunities and economic assets across the city, so much so that it is often difficult to distinguish the concentrations. This dispersion is compounded by the lack of master plans that could guide development and attract employment. Without coordinated growth plans, it is difficult to leverage these assets to their potential and create the spin-off economic activities that can result from clustered businesses in similar industries.
The City has identified priority growth areas that include regional employment centers, mixed-use centers, areas of high land capacity for growth, underserved areas of the city, land near the City Center, premium transit corridors and key arterial corridors.
Our efforts will focus on 13 regional centers—nine existing and four emerging. We can strategically focus employment and housing growth in those centers, aligning land use planning and infrastructure investment with economic development. These centers can offer a wide variety of employment-oriented uses, sites, infrastructure and amenities. Some also can be developed into vibrant, mixed-use areas that offer the live-work-play environments that are attracting development and business nationally, but are lacking in San Antonio. Continued employment and housing growth in these centers will also keep commute times low and offer more opportunities for transportation connections. 
San Antonio also has a number of large, transformational development projects that can change the direction of growth within the city. Four of these sites are Hemisfair, Brooks City Base, Port San Antonio and the Texas A&M University-San Antonio campus. Developing these sites can catalyze development in areas of the city where recent growth has been relatively limited. Even more significantly, these transformational projects are in areas with an ample supply of developable land. The large size, limited number of landowners and public and political backing for site development can result in model projects that will serve as a guide for future growth in the city."

  title: "Development Strategies for Connected Growth: Portland, Oregon"
  content: “The Portland Metro region in Oregon is perhaps the most frequently cited example of an American metropolis working to reduce its dependence on the automobile by creating more walkable neighborhoods, connected destinations and transportation choices. Portland has an elected and effective regional government (Metro) that coordinates urban growth in 24 cities and parts of three counties. Metro’s urban growth management plans include: Urban Growth Boundaries, a set of policies that protects fertile farmland and open space by limiting the development of sprawling suburbs and exurbs through strict controls over location of growth; Parking Management which allows developers and the housing market to determine parking ratios, saving them money and supporting Metro’s 2040 Growth Concept for mixed-use areas near light rail; and Transportation Choices which includes 5 major light rail extensions. Portland’s array of public policies that manage urban growth have created more compact forms of development, offering financial, mobility, environmental and livability benefits for the Metro area.”

heading-questions: "How can San Antonio utilize annexation strategically?
Should San Antonio grow (more so) into 	other counties?
How should San Antonio address development in unincorporated Bexar County?
What is the City’s role in providing infrastructure for new development in greenfield and annexation areas?
Should the City and SAWS direct growth through water provision policies and decisions?
How should the provision of services from SAWS, CPS Energy, VIA and others be connected to the City’s growth plans?"
heading-content: "As of 2013, San Antonio covered 467 square miles with a population density of 3,017 people per square mile. Historically, San Antonio has had no major physical or political constraints to outward expansion. However, that’s no longer the case. The city boundary and ETJ have effectively reached the northern edge of Bexar County as well as the boundaries of several other jurisdictions including Boerne, Bulverde, Converse, Live Oak, Schertz and Universal City. On the west, the city has begun to enter Medina County. This continued outward expansion has led to resources being spread across a large geographic area, and to a perception among some residents that there has been disinvestment in the inner portions of the city.
San Antonio can annex unincorporated areas of Bexar County. However, changes to the State’s annexation law in 1999 made it very difficult for the City to continue to annex new areas. Nonetheless, development continued in unincorporated Bexar, which put a strain on both the County and the City. Bexar County’s 2012 analysis showed that, like other Texas counties, it has limited capability to fund and provide acceptable urban-level services to new development. The County cannot adopt zoning, perform residential building inspections or raise enough revenue through bond issuance to offset infrastructure and service costs. Development that occurs in the county, within the city’s extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ), is subject to San Antonio’s subdivision and ordinance, but there are no mechanisms for applying or enforcing the City’s other development regulations. In some cases, these developments have created unforeseen impacts because the City has such limited control of the area.The Comprehensive Plan Initial Studies found that infill development has a greater fiscal benefit than building in undeveloped areas (greenfield development). This means that the City expends fewer resources providing infrastructure and ongoing services to infill areas. Building major infrastructure such as water and sewer systems and roads is typically costlier to the City for greenfield development sites. It is also more expensive for cities to provide ongoing police and fire service to areas under new development. 
San Antonio can develop a comprehensive approach to annexation that is consistent with growth forecasts and that ensures newly-annexed residents receive the same level of service as current residents—without creating undue burdens on the city."

  title: "Do SAWS and CPS impact City Form?"
  content: “The availability of utility services allows new development to occur around the city’s edges. However, until recently, San Antonio’s growth was not aligned with the service provision boundaries maintained by our major utility providers. Both SAWS and CPS serve areas that extend beyond the city boundary as well as the ETJ, and are required to fulfill any requests for service within those areas. In addition, SAWS and CPS typically benefit from expanding their infrastructure and prefer to provide service when requested to prevent competitive and/or substandard utility providers. If one of these utilities denies service to an area outside their service area boundary, the developer can find an alternative means of provision. SAWS and CPS tend to serve newly developing areas to ensure minimum standards are met. SAWS has sometimes been forced to take over operations of sewer plants because the provider couldn’t provide adequate service and maintain infrastructure. Expansion by our service providers may in some cases diverge from the Goals of the SA Tomorrow Comprehensive Plan. To address these potential conflicts, the City, SAWS and CPS should arrange regular coordination meetings to address impacts of planned development.”

heading-title: "Housing Stock"
heading-questions: "How can growth be managed in a way that respects and protects the city’s historic features, neighborhoods and cultural assets?
How can we leverage growth to support and improve the lives of our current and future residents?"
heading-content: "During the past decade San Antonio has been losing its competitive market position for single-family housing within the metro area; developers and homebuyers are looking outside city boundaries in unincorporated Bexar. However, this large amount of development still relies on City services and infrastructure. 
Since 2000, residential development has been located mainly in the north and northwestern portions of the county. But those areas are nearing build-out with a lack of available land, traffic congestion, topographic constraints and challenges for utility services. Land capacity will likely push future residential growth more to the west and south. The City’s policies and infrastructure (utilities, schools, services) will determine whether we attract development into San Antonio or continue expanding into other counties.
The City’s Comprehensive Plan Initial Studies found that there is not enough residentially-zoned land to accommodate forecasted demand for housing in several areas of the city, especially to the north if development continues with the same density and patterns. Increasing the density of some neighborhoods and the average density of single-family development will reduce the demand for additional land. Rezoning the vacant and underutilized commercial and industrial parcels (inside Loop 410) will allow development of residentially-focused mixed-use neighborhoods, greatly increasing the housing supply and walkability. Currently, only 14% of San Antonio’s neighborhoods offer walkability (defined as very or somewhat walkable), and most of those are in our historic districts.
At the same time, our historic neighborhoods are central to life in San Antonio. The 27 historic districts offer some of the most desirable places to live in San Antonio. Property values within historic districts have increased more than in other areas. They offer the characteristics of neighborhood types that are in demand locally and nationally, including walkability (all historic districts have higher Walk Scores than the citywide average), a greater mix of uses and shorter commute times to work. 
The City can develop policies to encourage higher-density housing in some areas while preserving our existing neighborhoods."
  
heading-title: "Natural Resources"
heading-questions: "How can growth be managed in a way that respects and protects the city’s natural resources?
Do the City and San Antonio Water System (SAWS) have enough water to serve future growth?"
heading-content: "The high-growth northern areas of Sac Antonio and Bexar County are bordered by environmentally sensitive natural resources. These include the Edwards Aquifer (one of the most important and sensitive aquifers in Texas), steep slopes of the Texas Hill Country, 100-year floodplain and critical wildlife habitats. The Comprehensive Plan Initial Studies showed that nearly 30% of land available for development in these sensitive areas was constrained. The topography also makes providing water and sewer service in those areas costly and difficult.
The City of San Antonio historically relied almost entirely on a single source of water, the Edwards Aquifer. With the creation of San Antonio Water System (SAWS), we have made great strides towards developing a sustainable supply of water for residents with water management planning, diversification of supply and an award-winning conservation program. While we still face challenges related to regulations, extreme weather and demand for water associated with outdoor irrigation, we continue to innovate.
One of these initiatives is the Twin Oaks Aquifer Storage and Recovery plant that stores water underground for peak use or drought. A more recent SAWS water supply diversification project is the Vista Ridge Pipeline. Although the 142-mile pipeline will provide the largest non-Edwards Aquifer water supply in the City’s history, consideration of and unanimous SAWS and City Council commitment to the project allowed for significant community debate regarding water reliability, SAWS rate restructuring and conservation and landscape irrigation controls.
Our City also leads in water conservation efforts, including the largest direct water recycling program in the nation—using recycled water to irrigate parks, golf courses, lawns, and the River Walk. Our continued efforts to address develop new diversification and conservation solutions will help ensure a more sustainable future for our community."

  title: "Smart Growth and Urban Containment Policies: Austin, Texas"
  content: “The City of Austin is bisected north-south by portions of the Edwards Aquifer, a sensitive source of drinking water. Although 34% of Austin’s land area is classified as “undeveloped,” much of it has environmental constraints. Austin’s predicted growth rate (double over 30 years) will place heavy demands on resources, infrastructure and services. To help mitigate the impact, the City has launched a series of planning initiatives to manage and direct growth; developed an extensive overlay system to identify and map environmentally sensitive lands and lands unsuitable for development; and established five “growth areas,” three where new development and redevelopment are desired and two where they are not. By mapping where Austin wants development, and providing infrastructure and tax break incentives, the City has enticed development in the desired areas and away from the open space and natural resources it wants to preserve.”

heading-title: "Education"
heading-questions: "How can we leverage growth and development to support educational access and achievement?"
heading-content: "There are 17 independent school districts operating within the San Antonio area with local control over the education system in their respective areas. While the City has a limited role in education, we can develop policies that encourage a broader variety of employment opportunities and housing choices across the city, especially in the southern, eastern and western areas of the city that have not traditionally seen high levels of economic growth. Neighborhood-friendly infill development can attract new families and improve the real estate market in those areas.
The City can also work to help provide land, facilities and entitlements that can be used to establish new schools as communities grow. And we can work closely with school districts in priority growth areas to support and enhance student success, including those in early childhood education programs."

title: "Transportation and Connectivity"
abbreviation: "TC"
lead-copy: "San Antonio has long enjoyed high quality of life complemented by a congestion-free network of roads and highways. Until recent years we all moved about our city with few impediments; new roads and ample parking were built in unison with the rapid outward expansion of development, particularly to the north and northwest parts of the city."
introduction-content: "San Antonio has many transportation assets that have kept congestion at bay and the transportation system working at an acceptable level of service, despite being the seventh largest city in the country. Our low cost of living, relatively short commute times and dispersed land uses all encouraged and facilitated a transportation culture dominated by automobiles. In fact, statistics show that 95% of us drive to work, while 5% percent either walk, bike or use public transit.
Continued reliance on single-occupancy-vehicle travel is not sustainable. Current traffic projections indicate that our road and highway network will be unable to accommodate the unprecedented growth anticipated over the next 25 years. We are already witnessing longer-than-average commutes during rush hour especially on the major highways and in the northwest part of town. While many people from around the country are attracted to our economic stability and low cost of living, both are in jeopardy if we continue “business as usual” when planning our transportation system. 
For a variety of environmental, economic development, and community health reasons, this plan calls for a new approach to transportation planning in our city. Expected congestion can no longer be managed simply by building new roads, and many of us have expressed a desire for more safe, comfortable and healthy transportation options. Walking, bicycling and transit must be prioritized. Many of us will continue to drive for some or all of our trips, but our city needs to provide a wider range of mobility choices that allow us access to work, recreation and other daily activities if we cannot or choose not to drive a car. 
The Transportation and Connectivity element is somewhat unique in this plan, as a separate Multimodal Transportation Plan is being developed concurrently as part of the SA Tomorrow effort. Because the Multimodal Transportation Plan will address the full range of mobility issues in great detail, this chapter examines San Antonio's transportation challenges and opportunities at a more comprehensive level, making connections to the other elements of this plan. 
The Transportation and Connectivity (TC) goals and policies were developed in response to the five key transportation challenges that follow."
   
heading-title: "Multimodal Network"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio increase access to, safety and use of multimodal transportation options for all residents?
How can we improve pedestrian safety and comfort throughout the city?
How can we more successfully implement and improve upon our long-range bicycle plan?
How and when can San Antonio implement high-capacity premium transit that links key residential areas and employment centers with healthcare, cultural, educational and recreational facilities?
How can San Antonio provide better regional non-automobile connections?"
heading-content: "The five questions above highlight the importance of alternative modes of transportation and illustrate the range of options we want to see incorporated throughout our city. Many San Antonio residents currently walk, bike and ride public transit, but there is much work to be done before these options are viewed as safe and desirable choices for the majority of residents. 
Walking
The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) has named San Antonio a Pedestrian Focus City, a classification of 22 cities that have pedestrian death rates higher than the national average. Along with Dallas, San Antonio has the highest average pedestrian fatality rate per 100,000 people in Texas based on data from 2010 through 2013. San Antonio’s existing pedestrian network includes gaps in existing sidewalks, sidewalks in disrepair, sidewalks with accessibility issues such as barriers and absent curb ramps, and even some roadways without sidewalks. Pedestrian safety is an area of focus for the City of San Antonio. Particular attention should be paid to ensure residents of all ages and abilities have the opportunity to safely walk to a variety of daily amenities and activities, such as transit stops, schools, local parks and trails, healthcare services, and employment and cultural destinations.
Bicycling
While bicycling is gaining popularity for both commuting and recreation, safety remains a concern. There were 258 bike crashes in San Antonio in 2013, increasing to 324 in 2014. Of even greater concern are the serious injuries and fatalities associated with increased bicycling. There were five fatal bike crashes in 2013 and one in 2014, all of which occurred on larger roadways (collectors and arterials). 
The Alamo Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (AAMPO) travel demand model shows that the majority of all bicycle trips in the network are 10 miles or less in distance and 48% of all trips are 10 minutes or less in duration. These shorter trips are ideal opportunities for bike travel if improved infrastructure is in place. When implemented, the projects detailed in the City’s 2011 Bike Master Plan will help reduce the danger of bicycling by providing a connected bicycle network of trails, bike lanes and other facilities throughout the city. 
San Antonio also has the BCycle bike-sharing program. Users can pick up a bike at any BCycle station and return it to any BCycle station when finished with their ride. Users can pay a membership fee to gain unlimited access to the BCycle system or they can pay based on the time that the bike is used. There are currently 55 BCycle stations in San Antonio. Most are located in Downtown; some are near the Mission and Museum Reaches of the Riverwalk, on the campus of San Antonio College and throughout the River North area. 
The City must continue to prioritize expanding of our bicycle network, creating a valuable amenity for residents and adding a distinctive element to entice and delight the many visitors our city attracts every year.
High-Capacity Transit
A regional high-capacity transit network, such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) or light rail, will not only help to reduce vehicle miles travelled (VMT), it will also help San Antonio meet future transportation demands of residents and businesses. Cities compete with each other for residents and businesses, and a robust rapid transit system is increasingly considered a hallmark of world-class cities. Two key demographics that cities compete for include millennials and baby boomers. Statistics show that both of these groups are driving less and demanding alternative modes of transportation. 	They are also less willing to pay a high percentage of their incomes for transportation costs. A high-capacity and high frequency transit network answers both of these concerns and could serve as a major attractor to these important demographics in our city.
The Transportation and Connectivity goals and policies of this Comprehensive Plan are aligned with the VIA Vision 2040 plan being concurrently developed by VIA Metropolitan Transit. This collaboration should continue, and both entities must focus on aligning VIA’s high-capacity transit corridors with the city’s regional centers and other key investments. 
Regional Mobility
The Lone Star Rail District (LSRD) had proposed a 118-mile passenger rail service from north of Austin to San Antonio. The proposed passenger rail service (LSTAR) would have operated on existing Union Pacific freight rail lines and offered 75-minute express service from Downtown Austin to Downtown San Antonio. 
Unfortunately, as of early 2016, Union Pacific has pulled out of the cooperative agreement with LSRD to provide commuter rail jeopardizing the proposed LSTAR line. However, there is still an expressed desire by stakeholders for regional rail connectivity. The City and rail district should continue to explore options that do not rely on Union Pacific tracks. Implementation of this regional rail connection will complement and link into the high-capacity transit network and demonstrate our City’s commitment to playing a larger role in the regional economy.
The full range of multimodal options described above will enhance our quality of life and improve our air quality and health outcomes. In addition, a robust mobility network is a desirable amenity to many skilled workers, increasing the chances that San Antonio can attract and retain a workforce that supports targeted industries at the heart of our economic development strategy."

  title: "Connecting People with Transit: Los Angeles, California"
  content: “First and last mile connections are a problem all cities face when talking about making public transit accessible to all residents. In cities like Los Angeles, which have a large and dispersed population, the challenge is that not many households and workplaces fall within a ¼ mile of a transit station. To help increase ridership and accessibility Los Angeles has implemented a new fist and last mile strategy to make the first and last mile between public transit access as enjoyable and easy as possible. To achieve this, Los Angeles has: partnered with ride-hailing and bike sharing services to decrease commute time to a transit station; developed ‘mobility centers’ (hybrid convenience store and bus stop); and increased wayfinding measures that outline multiple ways for users to get to their final destination. 
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) First-Last Mile Strategic Plan is moving the city towards a more enjoyable and accessible public transit system. By paying attention to the entire trip, specifically the first and last miles, the City is investing in a more coordinated infrastructure with the desire of extending the reach of transit and ultimately increasing ridership.”

heading-title: "Land Use and Transportation"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio enhance its transportation system to ensure residents have safe and easy access to a range of daily amenities and basic services?"
heading-content: "Walking, bicycling and high-capacity transit options must be integrated into a comprehensive network that provides San Antonio residents with multiple options for accessing residential, commercial, educational, cultural, healthcare and recreation opportunities throughout our city. In addition, this network must be coordinated and aligned with key land use objectives and investments that ensure a greater number of people live in close proximity to this range of multimodal options in the future. The City’s Complete Streets program, existing and planned linear greenway multi-use trails, and investments in regional centers should all be leveraged to achieve this goal. Our City must make a concerted effort to link regional centers with multimodal and transit corridors, providing multiple, non-automobile options for our residents traveling to and from work and other daily activities. Mobility within regional and urban centers is also important. Even if residents and employees must drive for some longer trips, many will choose other options for shorter trips that are easily reached by walking and biking. Expanded multimodal connections between and within employment and housing concentrations enhance our residents’ quality of life, increase access to employment and increases efficiency of our transportation system. 
Complete Streets
A Complete Street is a roadway planned, designed and operated to enable safe access for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders of all ages and abilities. There is no one type of Complete Street since roadways must serve different purposes for different land uses. Thus, Complete Streets are context-driven, with different components and amenities depending on the community served. While all Complete Streets are designed to accommodate all modes of travel in a safe, accessible and comfortable manner, they can be tailored to best serve the needs of surrounding communities, both existing and planned. 
Linear Greenway Trails
San Antonio is developing a world-class system of bike paths and trails through the linear greenway parks, which provide routes for bicyclists outside of the street network. The City, in collaboration with other agencies, created paths along Leon Creek, Salado Creek, Medina River, and the Mission and Museum Reaches of the San Antonio River. Future plans include extending existing paths further along the waterways and creating new paths along greenways such as San Pedro and Alazán Creeks. This network of greenway trails connects us to a variety of important destinations, provides a direct connection to our treasured natural resources and offers safe and beautiful routes for commuting, recreational or visiting cyclists. In addition, this trail network is the basis for the unique Trail-Oriented Development place type illustrated in Chapter Six.
Finally, strategic development of regional centers in San Antonio represents the city’s best opportunity to absorb and leverage projected population and employment increases while preserving the existing fabric of neighborhoods. These regional centers are one of the main building blocks of our city’s future. Each is at a different stage of development and offers unique potential in terms of combining land uses and multimodal connectivity. We must focus our efforts on carefully considered regional center plans that link existing and emerging land uses with our investments in walking, biking, and transit."

  content: “In 2008, the City of Cleveland completed the $197 million, 9-mile bus rapid transit (BRT) line, known as the HealthLine. The HealthLine connects Clevelands’s downtown to its health and education regional centers and its eastern neighborhoods along Euclid Avenue. With dedicated lanes, covered stations and electronic ticketing, the HealthLine has been instrumental in: spurring $5.8 billion in development along the Euclid Avenue corridor since 2008; increasing access to Cleveland’s medical, education and arts centers; and supporting the development of a multimodal network to compliment and support the BRT route. 
Considered one of the best US examples of BRT implementation, the scheme has generated $114.54 in economic development for each transit dollar spent and has seen a 60% increase in ridership over the old route. Significantly, a majority of the ridership growth has been in choice ridership – people who have a car but choose to ride public transportation.”

heading-title: "Congestion"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and proactively address anticipated future problems with congestion and transportation delays?"
heading-content: "One of the reasons San Antonio currently lacks a sufficient range of transportation options is that, even as recently as 2010, the transportation system operated at an acceptable level of service (LOS); congestion was really not a problem in our city. Level of service is a measure of delay and congestion on roadways and at intersections. It is reported by a letter grade of A through F, with A representing the ideal condition with very little delay and congestion present, and F representing over-capacity conditions with substantial delay and congestion. Although the city’s road network generally operated at an acceptable LOS in 2010, by 2013 it was ranked 43rd in the country for worst traffic congestion according to TomTom’s annual Traffic Index report. It had an overall congestion level of 15% (8% on highways and 22% on non-highways), compared to a 21% congestion rate in Houston and Austin and the 16% congestion rate in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. With an addition of 1.1 million people by year 2040 we will continue to see dramatic increases in demand on the transportation system. 
With vehicle miles travelled (VMT) increasing due to this continued growth, the levels of congestion will worsen. The City expects the largest increases in population on the far-west side, downtown and the far-north side areas. The north side of the city will be congested by 2040. All major roads on the north and west sides of the City outside of Loop 410 will be over capacity with the exception of Wurzbach Parkway. The south side will experience significant congestion as well, with most major north-south roads operating at LOS F. The inner east and southwest sides are the only areas of the city that will have available capacity on the road network.
Based on the AAMPO travel demand model results, congestion will result in a decrease in average speed (about 48%), meaning it will take twice as long to travel the same distance on the same roadway in year 2040 compared to year 2010. Total vehicle hours of delay will also increase by over 900% from 2010 to 2040.
We’ll need to use a wide range of tactics to manage and mitigate this future congestion. The expansion of multimodal and transit options described earlier in this chapter is one important approach. However, many of us will continue to drive, and we must explore innovative technologies and programs that will work in concert to manage and minimize the impacts of congestion on our roadways. The Multimodal Transportation Plan details a wide range of possible technologies and strategies. For example, Transportation Demand Management tools will help to reduce average VMT per person and shift roadway demand away from peak hours. The City should work with VIA to implement technologies that improve transit performance and reliability, especially on priority corridors. In addition, the City and VIA should test and implement a suite of roadway pricing and accessibility options such as managed lanes, high occupancy vehicle (HOV)/high occupancy toll (HOT) lanes and ramp metering to create the most efficient roadway system possible."

heading-title: "Effectiveness"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio update its transportation planning and facilities to meet current and future needs, including increasing demands from residents and businesses?"
heading-content: "In an era of increasing costs and limited resources, our City must invest in transportation improvements wisely. We seek to be a world leader in mobility and connectivity; to do so requires a holistic and innovative approach to our entire transportation system, and a more nuanced understanding of how people will choose to move about our city over the next 25 years. It will be crucial to coordinate efforts among City departments and between the City and VIA to ensure efficient transportation and mobility investments in the coming years.
The City took an important step toward efficient management of transportation planning and investment by creating the Transportation and Capital Improvements Department (TCI) in January 2014. TCI combines the former Public Works and Capital Improvements Management Services departments. The newly combined department employs over 800 people dedicated to meeting the infrastructure and transportation needs of our city. TCI is also the lead department on the Multimodal Transportation Plan, and will be instrumental in implementing the recommendations of that plan.
TCI manages the City’s five-year rolling Bond Program that funds over $500 million of capital improvement projects and other high-profile capital projects like the Henry B. Gonzales Convention Center expansion and the San Antonio Airport projects. Future Bond Programs should fund important infrastructure and mobility investments in our city’s regional centers, particularly in coordination with corresponding investments 
from VIA.
Considering the scale of our City’s Bond Program and other transportation investments, we must prioritize projects carefully to yield the most effective and impactful results. The Transportation and Connectivity policies in this Plan call for prioritization of projects based on long-term cost-effectiveness and value, emissions and VMT reductions, coordination with other large-scale projects and considerations of a project’s full life cycle costs."

heading-title: "Economic Competitiveness"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio update its transportation planning and facilities to meet current and future needs that strengthen its role in the regional, national, and international economy?"
heading-content: "Transportation and mobility impact not only our city’s environment and community health outcomes, but also serve as key economic development tools. Although often distant from our everyday lives, freight transportation is an important aspect of our system and is an important driver of our economic success. Freight moves through our city by roadway and rail.
Seven major railroad lines pass through San Antonio, all operated by Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR). Major rail yards are located at Port San Antonio, and along I-35 south of Fort Sam Houston. San Antonio’s proximity to the I-35 and I-10 corridors is a great economic asset with regard to movement of goods. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has greatly increased the movement of freight between Texas and Mexico, the state’s largest trading partner. Major freight rail and highway corridors originating on the Texas border in Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley all converge in and pass through San Antonio. Trade between Texas and Mexico has increased in recent years and is expected to continue to place additional demands on the City’s transportation infrastructure.
The recent growth and activity associated with the energy sector has also contributed to an increase of freight traffic. Drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale formation, primarily in counties south of San Antonio such as Karnes and Atascosa, has increased dramatically over the last several years. The Eagle Ford Shale formation produces over a million barrels of oil per day (Texas Railroad Commission). San Antonio is the nearest major city to the Eagle Ford Shale, located less than an hour away from the northern edge of the oil field. Major truck and rail corridors from the region pass through San Antonio. Many companies operating in the Eagle Ford, such as Halliburton and Baker Hughes, have now located in San Antonio. The large number of trucks and employees needed to drill and maintain oil wells has increased traffic on the highways heading to and from the south such as I-37 and US Highway 181.
Finally, as described in earlier parts of this chapter, an integrated and well-designed multimodal network is an important economic development tool. San Antonio’s current urban form—defined for the most part by low-density, single-use developments connected by an auto-centric transportation system—does not offer the kind of places that will attract today’s young, skilled, innovative workers. Continuing with the status quo and perpetuating the same basic development types and patterns that have dominated the city over the past few decades will all but ensure San Antonio’s inability to become a center of innovation and creative industry. 
Instead, we must plan for and encourage the creation of more neighborhoods and districts that offer the density, mix of uses, mobility options and amenities that draw skilled millennial workers, retiring baby boomers and many other segments of the population that crave a sustainable, walkable, and human-scaled place to live. San Antonio should continue with traditional business attraction efforts, and we also need to add the additional layer of strategic and holistic thinking about what will help bring targeted industries and businesses to the city. In this sense, the land use, urban design, and mobility goals and policies that punctuate almost every plan element are also economic development policies.
To be successful, we do not need to retrofit the entire city, and the status quo of city form dominated by an auto-centric transportation system and few places with true urban amenities will no longer work. The goals and policies articulated for this and other plan elements must address these challenges and work towards creating and linking great places to live, work and play."

title: "Housing"
abbreviation: "H"
lead-copy: "Our quality of life in San Antonio is very dependent on our housing and the neighborhoods we live in. It’s relatively affordable to live here. The cost of living is below the national average, as is the average home price."
introduction-content: "We have a strong cultural heritage that creates a unique sense of place. Our 27 historic districts offer some of the most attractive neighborhoods in the country, with charming houses, quiet streets, high walkability scores, a great mixture of uses and shorter commute times to work.
But we also have some real challenges. There is upward price pressure in the northern part of the city where the generally higher-paying jobs and better performing public schools are located. There are also large portions of the city with concentrations of low-income residents who don’t have access to the same quality of jobs and schools. 
The residential development market in San Antonio has been following two distinct trends: suburban/exurban low-density single-family development mainly in the north and west along Loop 1604, and urban infill multifamily development within the core of the city. The result is very little mixed-use development that offers a variety of housing options and prices with a physically and functionally integrated blend of residential, commercial, cultural, institutional or industrial uses. These compact, walkable mixed-use neighborhoods are a growing preference for homebuyers. 
As 500,000 new households are formed in Bexar County by 2040, we will see demand for a wide range of housing types, including single-family detached, row homes, townhomes, condos, multifamily and live/work spaces. 
What type of housing is built and where it will be built is largely dependent on the market—and on housing developers. Fortunately, San Antonio has capacity for infill development and can benefit from a close partnership with local housing developers who are already active in creating urban, mixed-use multifamily projects. We also have a strong network of nonprofit housing advocates, developers and providers. We can work together to address shifts in housing preferences, diversify our housing stock, expand the housing stock for buyers and renters at all price levels and meet our land use and economic objectives. 
We must plan for growth wisely and we must plan now to address the following five key areas of concern."
  
heading-title: "Affordable Housing"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio address significant income inequality and economic segregation issues present? 
How can the City stimulate housing and development in and near disadvantaged areas? 
How can the City provide housing for low- and moderate-income households in high opportunity areas? 
How can the City and its partners address the city’s affordable housing gaps and needs identified in the City’s Housing Needs Assessment and Strategic Housing Plan?
How can the City be proactive in mitigating impacts of gentrifying neighborhoods, especially near Downtown?"
heading-content: "The per capita income in San Antonio is $22,184, which is lower than both the Texas average of $26,327 and national average of $28,184. Our poverty rate was 19% in 2010, which is 2% higher than it was in 2000. With new developments catering mainly to wealthier single-family home buyers, we have experienced a clustering of low-income residents in areas with less expensive housing, mainly in the near-east and near-west side neighborhoods around downtown and in the southern part of the city. Recent studies have shown that San Antonio has one of the highest levels of income segregation in the country. We clearly have an affordable housing gap.
In an effort to address this growing gap we need to incorporate Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) strategies and goals into action-oriented City and San Antonio Housing Authority (SAHA) plans (refer to Housing A25).  AFH goals strive to increase low-income household access to neighborhoods of opportunity (both through place-based and mobility based strategies); identify fair housing issues and factors that impede home owner ownership for low-income families; and develop strategies to address these issues and factors. 
While helping lower-income residents through providing education and jobs to improve their economic condition is important—and addressed in other elements—improving the neighborhoods they live in can also have a significant impact. A 2013 Harvard University/University of California at Berkeley study of metro areas found that when low-income families are residentially segregated from middle-income families, they have a very low rate of upward economic mobility. It also showed that improving the neighborhood a child grows up in has a direct positive correlation with the child’s future success.
The recent successful infill housing in the Central Business District and other areas of the urban core has raised concerns about gentrification. Many cities have succeeded in their efforts to make a neighborhood a more prosperous and desirable place to live, but at the price of driving out long-time residents who could no longer afford to live there. Gentrification is not yet an extensive issue here, so we can take steps now to prevent it.
By identifying in advance those neighborhoods where gentrification may occur, we can develop policies and strategies to prevent the loss of affordable housing and help current residents adjust to market changes without being displaced. For example, we can develop housing initiatives focusing on residents with incomes below 80% of the area median. We can create strategic investment plans with nonprofit housing providers and provide fee waivers and/or waived development requirements for affordable housing development and preservation.
Sometimes simply designating an area for public infrastructure improvements or as a regional center for future development can drive up land values as market forces anticipate the change. Planning in advance for where those sites will be allows us and nonprofits to take steps like purchasing sites while the land values are still low and “banking” them for a few years until the time is right to develop them for affordable housing or other community services."

  title: "Combating Gentrification: Portland, Oregon"
  content: “Portland is one of the most livable cities in the country, attracting young professionals, empty nesters and others with disposable incomes seeking an urban lifestyle. Entire neighborhoods have been transformed by this growth. But this urban success story has come at a price—rising housing prices are driving out long-time residents with lower incomes who can no longer afford to live there. A staggering 58% of Portland’s neighborhoods have experienced gentrification, the highest rate among the nation’s 50 largest cities. Portland Plan, the City’s 2012 strategic plan, adopted policies and actions to address this challenge. The 11-point plan calls for such actions as: Affordability and Displacement Impact Analysis studies before the City rezones communities or invests in major transit or other public improvements; encouraging mitigation when those studies show people might be displaced; and Community Benefits Agreements like those requiring developers to hire locally and pay a living wage. 
The City also developed a gentrification and risk assessment map that identifies neighborhoods at early, mid and late stages of gentrification. By predicting where the next wave of gentrification is likely occur, the City can work with residents and developers to ensure that people are able to remain in their homes and benefit from the changes in their neighborhoods.”

heading-title: "Housing Choice"
heading-questions: "How can the City expand the market for housing, and capture an increased share of all housing types regionally?"
heading-content: "Despite recent strong growth in San Antonio, we are facing increased housing competition from neighboring communities and unincorporated Bexar County. Land costs are lower outside the city, and we’ve not been annexing land during the past decade. As a result, we’ve been capturing a decreasing share of the regional growth in single-family housing. And the city’s capture of all types of new households in the metropolitan area has been declining steadily since 2000, from 77% of new units in 2001 to 58% in 2012. Decreased growth and not continuing to annex outward are not necessarily bad, but it does indicate that the city is becoming less competitive especially in the suburban single-family market.
The large, single-family developments in unincorporated areas of the county also generate large populations that rely on City infrastructure but are outside our land use controls and pay no property tax to the City. The Comprehensive Plan Initial Studies fiscal analysis found that new outward expansion is less fiscally beneficial to the City than are infill developments of all types. The analysis also found that compact, walkable communities offer three-to-four times greater fiscal benefits than do the traditional suburban residential neighborhoods than have been built during the past 50 years. 
The City can ensure that land use designations and zoning districts allow and encourage a mixture of housing types and affordable housing units in development projects and provide incentives in targeted areas to increase the housing types that are in undersupply. We can also develop housing initiatives targeting not only the lowest income families, but also those with incomes between 80% and 120% of the median income. These initiatives facilitate the development of housing for low and moderate-income households in more affluent areas, while guarding against excessive gentrification within inner city neighborhoods."

heading-title: "Connected Neighborhood"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio accommodate and provide more housing in and around where people work and play?
How can the City increase the walkability of San Antonio and its neighborhoods?"
heading-content: "Current development patterns make walking or biking within and between neighborhoods difficult, increasing reliance on the automobile. An analysis of housing preferences and existing housing conditions shows an unmet demand for walkable neighborhoods. Only 14% of San Antonio neighborhoods have Walk Scores that indicate it’s a very or somewhat walkable location, and most of those are in our historic districts. While there have been some new single-family development projects with a more walkable design, it’s clear that there is demand for even more, evidenced by the high market values of the historic districts.
Encouraging walkable residential development not only diversifies the housing stock, these types of neighborhoods have positive impacts on health as well. Environments that encourage walking and biking increase residents’ physical activity, which can help address health problems such as obesity, which is on the rise in San Antonio. Reduced auto use will also improve air quality. 
The City can adopt development standards for new housing that requires designs, land use and infrastructure (such as pedestrian and bike paths and lanes) that support safe walking, biking and transit use within the neighborhood and to surrounding neighborhoods, work and amenities. 	We must also work with nonprofit affordable housing providers so that our current residents won’t be priced out of participating in these neighborhood initiatives."

heading-title: "Priority Areas"
heading-questions: "How can the City create attractive housing in priority growth areas?
How can the City provide housing and neighborhoods that are attractive to young professionals and an educated workforce?"
heading-content: "The City has identified priority areas where housing can be increased: regional employment centers, urban centers, mixed-use centers, premium transit corridors, key arterial corridors, underserved areas of the city, areas of the city where there is high land capacity for growth and land near the city center.
San Antonio’s polycentric economic geography, with large concentrations of employment and housing throughout the city, makes living near work more likely for many residents. There are eight regional employment centers that can become “Activity Centers” where we concentrate growth in employment, housing and amenities such as entertainment, retail and educational and cultural institutions. Portions of other center types currently are, or can be, attractive mixed-use areas supporting a range of housing types. The 13 regional centers can capture more than half of multifamily development during the next 30 years, transforming many areas into vibrant, high-density, highly walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods. (See Chapter 5, “Regional Centers” for maps and analysis.)
It’s also more fiscally sustainable to concentrate higher-density housing and employment in regional centers and near transit stations than to continue the outward growth beyond the city’s borders. Timing is critical. As the market realizes a neighborhood is being revitalized, land prices start to rise. We can develop specific action plans now that will support a mix of uses and higher-density development and provide incentives for developers to move quickly to provide a range of housing options. We can also invest in neighborhood amenities and infrastructure that will attract new employers, retail businesses and residents."

Since September 2015 this City Council-appointed Commission has been working to tackle complex issues such as: zoning and development codes, manufactured housing, and the planning for San Antonio’s first potential affordable housing bond.
In partnership with City staff, the Housing Commission is completing a first-of-its-kind assessment. This valuation has a two-pronged approach. First we will identify existing policies and programs that increase the cost of developing new affordable housing and contribute to the loss of existing affordable housing. That will be followed up by proposed policy changes to mitigate those impacts. The results of the Policy & Program Assessment are anticipated by late 2016.”

heading-title: "Infill Neighborhoods"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio preserve and rehabilitate its existing and aging housing stock, especially its affordable housing stock?
How can the City address the needs of its existing residents as they age in the community, especially the city’s seniors?"
heading-content: "Multifamily housing development has been increasing in the inner core of San Antonio. Over 30% of all apartment development (the number of units under construction, approved or planned) is taking place within Loop 410. The area still has a large number of vacant and underutilized parcels, indicating the buildings are out of date and the sites are not meeting market demand for their current zoning designation. Allowing them to redevelop with a new mixture of uses, and specifically introducing housing, can help revitalize those areas and improve the neighborhoods around them.
Some neighborhoods are already engaged in long-term revitalization. Examples of revitalization programs providing replicable best practices from the EastPoint effort, including Choice Neighborhood, Eastside Promise Neighborhood and Eastside Promise Zone. We must provide a revitalization toolbox to existing neighborhoods and developers to encourage and guide investment in our existing neighborhoods. 
Recent infill development has raised some concerns about the compatibility of those developments with existing neighborhoods, in terms of character, design and perceived density. Context-sensitive development policies can ensure the character of neighborhoods is enhanced by new development. 
We can also help seniors remain in their homes through programs that support retrofitting, repairing and maintaining their homes. Or, if they choose to move to more walkable neighborhoods near amenities, we can ensure there are housing options for seniors available. 
The City is now coordinating housing and community development through an interagency collaborative. REnewSA takes a place-based approach aimed at restoring the vitality of existing neighborhoods and commercial corridors. The partnership is led by the City of San Antonio’s Department of Planning & Community Development and includes nonprofit housing providers, Build San Antonio Green, the San Antonio Housing Authority, and the City’s Office of Historic Preservation, OUR SA (Office of Urban Redevelopment), Transportation & Capital Improvements Department, Development Services Department, Center City Development Office and Office of Sustainability."

  content: “With a population, expected to double by 2035, Denver began the largest expansion of mass transit in the country in 2004. But as light rail, new lines and stations were built, costs of nearby housing began to soar. This inspired the first affordable housing Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) acquisition fund in the country, a partnership of government, quasi-governmental organizations, banks, nonprofits and foundations. This innovative financing mechanism provides affordable housing choices where market forces alone might otherwise have made that impossible. By making strategic property acquisitions in current and future transit corridors the fund purchases land for affordable housing at stations and makes capital available at low rates, allowing affordable housing developers time to arrange financing to buy the site later. 
By “banking” the land in Denver’s TOD corridors, the fund supports affordable housing in the region, especially for low-income populations that are frequently transit-dependent.”

title: "Jobs and Economic Competitiveness"
abbreviation: "JEC"
lead-copy: "San Antonio is an attractive place to do business. We’re business friendly, with an affordable tax environment and business-friendly government supportive of new and developing businesses."
introduction-content: "We’re strategically located near the major sea ports of Houston and Corpus Christi and on the roadway and railway corridors that connect with Mexico, Canada, and the East and West Coasts. We have world-class universities and colleges. Our City-owned utilities, CPS Energy and San Antonio Water System, provide affordable energy and water with stable pricing. And, perhaps most important, San Antonio offers a high quality of life with a focus on family that attracts young workers.
There’s no doubt that our city has strong assets and emerging economic opportunities.
But in the coming years, we must focus on opportunities and challenges that have been uncovered in an honest assessment of our city’s economic competitiveness and the jobs available to our residents. Our economic geography lacks modern planning, the airport is constrained, our workforce lags behind in education and wages, college graduates are leaving the city and there’s a lack of diversity in jobs and wage levels.
As in many other elements, it’s clear that without a unifying, long-term plan, the region may very well be headed toward a stagnating economy with minimal job gains in an increasing competitive global market. The Jobs and Economic Competitiveness (JEC) goals and policies were developed to meet the five economic key challenges for our city that follow."
  
heading-title: "Economic Geography"
heading-questions: "How can we better define and take advantage of our distinct polycentric economic geography to enhance the potential benefits of emerging industry clusters?"
heading-content: "Generally speaking, employment and economic assets are widely dispersed throughout the city and not well connected. The scattered assets are largely due to the lack of appropriate master plans to guide/attract employment growth to guide adequate land use controls and industry and geographic-specific incentives. Reflective of the nature of the major economic drivers present in San Antonio, these challenges have meant the City can’t fully leverage these assets to create clustered businesses and spin-offs in similar industries.
However, a detailed analysis of job density also shows that jobs have somewhat organically concentrated into nine existing and four emerging regional centers along major transportation routes (see Regional Centers by Status on next page). About 50% of all jobs in San Antonio are within those 13 regional economic centers, which have captured over half of all non-residential development since 2000. 
Looking holistically at this polycentric pattern of regional centers can fundamentally change the way San Antonio envisions land use, urban form, transportation and community in the future. By developing strategic growth plans that align economic development with land use planning, public transit and infrastructure investment, these 13 regional centers can offer a wide variety of opportunities for employment-oriented uses, sites, infrastructure and amenities. Clustering similar industries within these centers will create formal and informal interactions between businesses, spurring additional economic activity. 
Downtown has been, and should continue to be, a major economic focus because it anchors the multi-billion dollar tourism industry, has great potential to attract innovative and creative industries whose workers seek vibrant urban environments, and makes cost-effective use of large infrastructure investments already in place in the city’s core. But other existing and emerging centers need similar levels of attention and investment to help them develop, promoting equity and access throughout the region 
As compatible development surrounding bases is identified and prescribed, San Antonio should work with the military to attract developers who specialize in creating affordable, community-focused housing.  As with development in all parts of our city, access to transportation, green spaces, parks, trails, and proximate healthcare are all factors to consider. 
Each center is different and its development will be directed by its existing uses (particularly those oriented to military, aviation or heavy industry). However, some of the centers are well positioned to develop as vibrant mixed-use places that offer a range of housing options and price ranges, allow higher-density and incorporate carefully designed and located amenities that will benefit both residents and employees of the center, as well as people in adjacent neighborhoods. These live-work-play environments attract development and businesses nationally, but are lacking in San Antonio. 
The partnership of an active institution such as a university or an innovative large employer, working in concert with the City and other partners, can bring significant and rapid positive changes to areas that would otherwise remain vacant or underutilized for many years. We will also need to invest in and encourage greater multimodal and transit connections between all the centers, as well as other key corridors and activity areas. 
Innovative, creative thinking about these regional centers and encouraging and supporting appropriate growth within them is a key strategy for preserving our existing lower-density, single-family neighborhoods so they retain their character in the face of significant expected population and job growth."

heading-title: "Economic Diversity"
heading-questions: "How can we diversify our economic base and attract jobs with higher wages?"
heading-content: "San Antonio is home to the corporate headquarters of USAA, Valero Energy, NuStar, Whataburger, Southwest Business Corporation (SWBC) and HEB Grocery stores, with a combined total of approximately 40,000 employees. But our economy is mainly driven by four major industries: tourism, healthcare, the military and education (see sidebar). Between 2000 and 2012, these industries increased in employment by 80,811 jobs and accounted for 80% of new jobs in the city. The issue for the City is that while these industries provide a strong economic base, they offer wages 20% below average. The average annual wage for workers in Bexar County was about $45,000 in 2014. The average annual wage of workers in those four industries was $36,179. These industries are also dependent on changeable state and federal policy and spending levels. 
Going forward, economic development efforts need to shift to industries that produce employment in the 21st century, including business within specifically targeted industry sectors.
There is growing recognition and active efforts to diversify and expand our economic base into 21st century industries that provide better wages, diversify the economy of San Antonio and can be leveraged to develop support businesses, startups and spin-offs. These targeted industries include:
Biosciences and Scientific R&D 
Local operations represent nationally recognized cutting-edge biotech companies and well-respected global enterprises like Medtronic and Becton Dickinson. Global-minded companies like Xenex and Canadian medical device company Innovative Trauma Care, as well as German biosciences company Cytocentrics, have noticed and have chosen to make San Antonio their base of operations.
Information Technology/Cybersecurity
This burgeoning industry is anchored by IT hosting company Rackspace, which is attracting more companies involved in Internet infrastructure such as Peer 1 Hosting, a Canada-based company, recently located an office in the Pearl. Another example is Geekdom, a start-up incubator and co-working space located in San Antonio. 
Cybersecurity companies continue to grow in San Antonio due to the presence of the Air Force’s Cyber and Intelligence Commands and the NSA’s Texas Cryptologic Center.
Advanced Manufacturing
Boeing, Standard Aero and General Dynamics, all located in Port San Antonio, are leaders in the aerospace industry. Toyota has a major manufacturing plant in the southern area of the city. This category includes aerospace, auto, heavy equipment and other high-automation manufacturing.
New Energy
CPS Energy is partnering with a consortium of businesses focused on solar, battery, and other power storage and distribution opportunities, such as solar module manufacturer Mission Solar Energy that is located at Brooks City Base. The city is near the Eagle Ford Shale formation along I-37 and I-35, and oil and natural gas drilling companies rely on us to provide support services. 
Cultural and Creative 
This industry is aspirational, reflecting the recognition that creativity and cultural uniqueness will play an increasingly important role in our economy. San Antonio’s burgeoning art, music and film industries are staking out a global identity that will attract a desirable workforce and innovative companies. New cutting edge firms, such as Tribu and HeartFire Media, are popping up every day. 
One of San Antonio’s traditional value propositions for attracting companies, low-cost labor, no longer entices targeted industries in the way it once lured call centers and other back-office operations. Instead, the city’s ability to grow and attract these newer industries will be based on the expertise, relationships and funding options associated with the area’s military bases, growing research universities and spin-off companies emerging from those great assets.
Our Traditional Economic Assets 
San Antonio’s economy is mainly driven by four traditional industries: Tourism/Hospitality, Healthcare, Education and the Military. 
Tourism/Hospitality
Over 80% of our 31 million annual visitors come to San Antonio to explore our city’s cultural, historic and leisure activities. Some of our most popular sites include: 
The San Antonio Missions UNESCO World Heritage Site including The Alamo; 
River Walk;
Yanaguana Garden;
Tobin Center for the Performing Arts;
SeaWorld San Antonio and Six Flags Fiesta Texas;
Market Square;
Pearl Brewery; and
Historic neighborhoods including King William, Mahncke Park and Monte Vista.
In recent years we have also become a top destination for conventions, hosting 6.2 million business visitors annually. In 2016, our new Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center and Hemisfair area are scheduled to be completed.
Healthcare
The South Texas Medical Center is a major cluster of healthcare facilities, with 45 institutions and supporting facilities, including 12 hospitals, five specialty institutions and the University of Texas Health Science Center, a leading health education center. The San Antonio Military Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston is the largest military hospital in the United States and the only Level 1 Trauma Center, bringing in patients and their families from all over the world. 
The Military
We’re known as “Military City, USA.” The US military has been active in San Antonio for over 300 years. Currently, we’re home to three major bases, Fort Sam Houston, Lackland Air Force Base and Randolph Air Force Base. Along with eight other operating areas and the almost 30,000-acre Camp Bullis training camp, these facilities together form the largest joint base operations for the Department of Defense. The facilities house major cybersecurity, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance services. Additionally, NSA Texas/the Texas Cryptologic Center are located in northwest San Antonio.
Education
More than 160,000 students attend the 15 higher education institutions located within 50 miles our city, including: the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); the growing Texas A&M University-San Antonio; the UT Health Science Center; Texas State University; Trinity University; University of the Incarnate Word (UIW); St. Mary’s University; Our Lady of the Lake University; Wayland Baptist University; Texas Lutheran University; and the Alamo Community College District with its five colleges.

  content: “Since the early 2000s, the University of California San Francisco’s (UCSF) Mission Bay Campus has transformed a mostly-vacant former rail yard into a state-of-the-art biotechnology campus. Today, UCSF is an economic engine for San Francisco, as well as the anchor of the city’s largest urban development in several decades. Mission Bay’s success is largely due to cooperation and collaboration between the university, the City, landowners and the surrounding community. 
Strategic land and space planning is contributing to the rapid growth of the Mission Bay Campus, the surrounding neighborhoods and the biotechnology industry in San Francisco. 
The master planning process allowed the City to work with UCSF to: foster regional development in the biotechnology industry; create a supportive mixed-use development program; and engage the community to minimize potential neighborhood impacts of Mission’s Bay development.  
Regional center planning that incorporates increased development flexibility available in mixed-use centers, an expanded appetite for density in key areas and a more robust approach to regional transit will yield fiscal, environmental, mobility and social benefits for the City and its residents and businesses.”

heading-questions: "How can we grow and attract a more educated workforce?"
heading-content: "San Antonio is behind the state and the country in workers age 25 to 34 with bachelors and advanced degrees. We also lag behind our peer Texas cities (Austin, Houston, and Dallas). It’s not that the education is not available here. Many of our college graduates leave San Antonio, citing a lack of attractive, dense neighborhoods that are important to young professionals, lack of centralized social centers, inadequate public transit and the low walkability. 
As our young people plan their lives, we need to ensure that they have access to the education that supports both traditional and targeted emerging industries and attractive job opportunities locally.
And we need to ensure that our college graduates—and graduates from other areas—find San Antonio an attractive place to live and work. Younger workers have demonstrated a greater affinity than previous generations for moving to and raising families in distinctly vibrant urban environments. They are the living embodiment of the idea that great places are defined by their power to attract and engage people. San Antonio’s current urban form—defined for the most part by low-density, single use developments connected by an auto-centric transportation system—does not offer the kind of places that attract today’s young, skilled, innovative workers. Continuing with the status quo and perpetuating the same basic development types and patterns that have dominated the city over the past few decades will hamper San Antonio’s goal of developing into a center of innovation and creative industry. 
Instead, the city must plan for and encourage more neighborhoods and districts that offer the density, mix of uses, mobility options, and amenities that draw skilled millennial workers, retiring baby boomers, and many other segments of the population that crave sustainable, walkable and human-scaled places to live.
In this sense, our land use, urban design, and mobility goals and policies are also economic development policies."

Led by strong growth in the innovation and high-tech sectors, Greater Austin ranked among the top metropolitan regions for economic recovery and job growth, and was listed as a top relocation city for young professionals, entrepreneurs, and students among mid-sized cities. Austin’s rise did not happen overnight, but rather was a carefully structured process that included: decades of strategic collaboration between government, academic and industry partners fostering policies to attract and retain high tech and innovation companies to the region; creation of an entrepreneurial business climate that supports a strong regional economy; and capitalizing on its unique location and quality of life as a differentiating factor in luring the top talent from around the country.
Austin’s ability to successfully attract technology firms, cultivate homegrown technology start-ups and lure young professionals has led to the development of some of the city’s most vibrant and growing regional sectors of the economy.”

Policies and programs that increase access to multimodal transportation, parks and open space, recreation activities, healthy foods, healthcare services and educational opportunities all enhance community health in San Antonio."
introduction-content: "Healthcare is a major economic driver in Bexar County, and San Antonio residents have access to numerous high-quality healthcare resources. 
In spite of that, many in the San Antonio community face serious health challenges. In 2016, of 241 measured counties in Texas, Bexar County ranked 81st in overall health outcomes, 31st in health behaviors, 61st in length of life and 148th in quality of life. In 2014, almost 1 in 3 residents was obese, while 1 in 7 had diabetes.
Health outcomes in San Antonio must improve. As in many other elements, it’s clear that “business as usual” can’t continue. The Community Health and Wellness (CHW) goals and policies were developed to meet the six health and wellness challenges for our City that follow."

heading-title: "Healthcare and Food"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio improve access to healthcare, education, healthy food and recreational and exercise opportunities?
How can San Antonio increase opportunities for and support of healthy food production, distribution and equitable access?"
heading-content: "Access to healthcare, defined as the percentage of the civilian population under 65 with health insurance coverage, remains a challenge in San Antonio. Although access to healthcare stood at 73% in 2012 and increased under the Affordable Care Act, there are still unaddressed gaps in healthcare coverage. In 2014, 23% of adults and 8% of children in Bexar County were uninsured. In 2012, 19% of respondents in the community health assessment reported delaying medical care due to cost. Even those with insurance find that healthcare resources are not equally distributed across the region. In addition, there are limited non-auto transportation options for reaching healthcare destinations.
Access to healthy foods is also an ongoing concern. According to the 2013 Bexar County Community Health Assessment, only 22% of adults eat three or more vegetables per day, and only 12% eat three or more fruits. Among children, 40% eat five or more fruits and vegetables daily, but 25% also consume at least one soda a day. Fresh food is simply hard to find in some areas: 40% of the county’s urbanized population lived at least one mile from a grocery store and the number of farmers markets decreased by 26% between 2009 and 2013 while they increased in both Texas and the US. Contributing to the lack of healthy options, 52% of all restaurants—in both the county and the city—are fast food establishments. 
Although the full impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is not yet clear, the proportion of uninsured residents is expected to decrease over the long term. But more actions will be needed to address the uneven distribution of healthcare facilities, limited transportation options and other factors making it difficult for residents to have equitable access to healthcare resources. The process of improving access can begin by first identifying where gaps in healthcare resources at the community level may exist. This information can then be used in partnership with community leaders and public transit agencies to design and implement solutions that improve access to and availability of healthcare resources in each community where problems have been identified. 
Efforts to improve access to healthy food can also begin by identifying which areas in the city lack access to affordable fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low fat milk, and the other foods that make up a healthy diet. Knowing where these “food deserts” exist will allow us to target these communities and implement policies that support the development of affordable, healthy food options. 
A critical strategy will be to encourage the development of grocery stores offering healthy, natural foods along with farmer's markets, community gardens and other amenities within ¼ to ½ mile walking distance of all neighborhoods. We also need to educate community members about the value of good nutrition and healthy foods and discourage the consumption of fast foods and unhealthy, highly processed foods."

With support from local officials, corporations, foundations and the community, the gardens 
help to: improve food quality and access for kids and families; elevate community health practices and sustainability; and foster opportunities for social, education and recreation activities.  
The Urban Garden Program is an exemplary model for other cities to emulate in their efforts to educate children and adults on the benefits of healthy living and sustainability.”

heading-title: "Physical Activity"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio expand parks, trails, and recreation opportunities and ensure equitable access to these important assets citywide?"
heading-content: "Inadequate physical activity is a major source of health issues. Despite programs that promote healthy lifestyles, physical activity levels in San Antonio have declined in recent years. Between 2010 and 2013, regular participation in physical education in schools declined from 55% to 43%. The community also believes that physical activity is not encouraged on local streets because of the city’s narrow lanes, lack of bicycle facilities, poor lighting, potholes, lack of sidewalks and prohibitions against playing in the street.
The city does have a robust parks and recreation system. In 2014, there were 18 acres of parkland for every 1,000 residents. Because of population growth, the park ratio declined from 2010 when there were 20.7 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, although it is still above the national average. But more significantly, the size and distribution of parks in the city is uneven. As a consequence, only 33% of the population lives within walking distance of a park. 
In the short term, the City can work with local schools, as it is now doing with SPARK parks, to allow open access to school playgrounds during non-school hours. 
Long term, the City needs to provide parks and recreation amenities on a citywide basis, with a particular focus on areas that are currently underserved. It can also work to provide access to other green space such as community gardens, orchards, trails, greenways and creekways. By developing a network of bike lanes physically separated from vehicle lanes and connected with creek sub-street bike paths, the City could provide seamless, safe citywide travel for bicyclists. Development codes can also be reviewed and revised to improve walkability and provide recreation/play opportunities within the public realm."

heading-title: "Water"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio continue ongoing efforts to expand and diversify San Antonio’s water supply and to improve conservation measures throughout the city?"
heading-content: "The City of San Antonio historically relied almost entirely on a single source of water, the Edwards Aquifer. Through water management planning, diversification of supply and an award-winning conservation program, San Antonio has made great strides towards developing a sustainable supply of water. SAWS has diversified its water sources to reduce reliance on the Edwards Aquifer and added new sources, including the Twin Oaks Aquifer Storage and Recovery plant that stores water underground for peak use or during droughts. The City also has the largest direct water recycling program in the nation, using recycled water to irrigate institutional, commercial and industrial campuses, as well as parks, golf courses, lawns and the River Walk.
Water quality in San Antonio is excellent. In 2012, Bexar County met the national benchmark for safe drinking water—absolutely no samples from SAWS facilities had health-based violations. This contrasts with the rest of the state, where 6% of the population obtained drinking water from sources with health-based violations.
However, San Antonio still faces challenges related to regulations, extreme weather and demand for water associated with outdoor irrigation. In response, SAWS has developed an ambitious plan to expand the water supply and to save water through conservation measures. 
In addition to developing new water supply sources, the City and its regional partners should work together to protect all existing water sources. A land management plan can protect the recharge zones of the Edwards Aquifer and other area waterways by discouraging land-intensive development patterns in the Edwards Aquifer. The City can further protect these vital water supply sources by working with the San Antonio River Authority (SARA) to develop and update plans, standards and regulations for development on or near watersheds, aquifers, flood zones and stream restoration areas. The City can also identify aquifer recharge areas and acquire them as open space, using voter approved sales tax proceeds. 
The SAWS water quality protection program is one of the most aggressive in the state and includes sampling, monitoring and enforcement. Based on this strong foundation, a sound water quality protection plan will ensure the City can continue to provide clean water at affordable rates far into the future."

heading-title: "Transportation"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio enhance multimodal transportation options and choices and encourage active transportation?"
heading-content: "Land use patterns in San Antonio over the past 60 years have created a transportation system dominated by single-occupancy automobile trips. Biking, walking and transit lag far behind as ways to get around the city. Over the five-year period from 2009-2013, 95% of San Antonio residents traveled to work by car: only 3.5% of workers rode public transit, 2% walked to work and less than 0.25% cycled to work. 
We have taken measures to improve this situation. Our Parks & Recreation Department has developed 50 miles of greenway multiuse trails and has plans for 40 more miles of trails. VIA Metropolitan Transit has developed a plan to provide more frequent and efficient transit service along major transit corridors and provide better transit mobility between important activity centers. Along with a recent bicycle plan and a new focus on pedestrian safety, San Antonio is beginning to lay the foundation for a safer and more efficient transportation system that safely links pedestrian, bicycle and bus travel. 
Still, we need to make much more progress to create a more human-scaled, inclusive and sustainable city where people can get to work, school, personal activities and daily tasks without getting into their cars. Capital improvement and incentive programs that focus on building, expanding and improving pedestrian, bicycle and transit-oriented infrastructure should be a priority. 
We can continue to encourage programs and projects that make the City’s bicycle network more accessible, direct and continuous. We can promote urban forms that reinforce bicycling, pedestrian and transit activity by encouraging and providing incentives for developments close to destinations within walking or bicycling distance. We can develop sidewalks and trails integrated into the transportation system and activity areas such as schools, shopping and neighborhood centers. And we can develop a system of safe routes to schools, while we ensure ADA accessibility in all public realm improvement projects."
  
heading-title: "Health Outcomes"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio improve individual and community health outcomes (as measured by comparative health metrics and indices)?"
heading-content: "Data collected from national, state and local sources indicates that individual health concerns in San Antonio are varied, widespread and tied to the health of the broader community. Obesity stands out as one of the most crucial health concerns. In general, racial and ethnic minorities with lower educational attainment and income levels have the worst health outcomes.  
As a response to these increasing challenges, the City designated health and active living as top priorities for the region. In 2010, San Antonio formed the Active Living Council to promote the integration of physical activity into people’s daily routines. The Active Living Plan for a Healthier San Antonio provides a set of policies and strategies that public and private institutions can implement across eight community sectors. And the <a href='https://www.sa2020.org/'>SA2020</a> Vision Report lays out a strong vision for a healthy community with an online dashboard that tracks progress towards these targets. The latest <a href='https://www.sa2020.org/'>SA2020</a> dashboard results show that the City is making progress, is on track, or has met target goals in all areas except for air quality, walkability and vehicles miles traveled.
Despite these achievements, there is much room for improvement. Community health issues are integrated with many other elements of the City including land use, urban design, transportation, economics and community services. To improve our health scores and enhance the safety and resiliency of city assets and services, San Antonio should consider the interactions of the natural and built environments on the provision and quality of services provided.
Our approach must be regional to have a significant impact on community health. Active partnerships between the City, County, adjacent municipalities, healthcare organizations, school districts, numerous nonprofits and other organizations can support the design and implementation of public health services, coordinate healthcare education and awareness programs, and support efforts to shape a built environment that supports community health goals. For example, we can inform developers about the role the built environment plays in influencing individual and community health, and all large-scale land use and development projects can be required to include an assessment of the impact they will have on community health."

  content: “The San Diego region enjoys many assets including rich cultural diversity, a robust economy, wonderful weather, world renowned educational and research institutions, and more—all of which provide an excellent quality of life. Yet, data clearly showed that residents were experiencing increasing rates of chronic diseases, accounting for over 50% of deaths in San Diego County. In response to these alarming trends, the Svan Diego County Board of Supervisors adopted in 2010 a regional vision known as Live Well San Diego. This program reflects a new way of thinking about and working toward solutions, new definitions and measures of success, and the recognition that no one organization can do it all. To achieve its goals, Live Well San Diego: built a collaborative network of 120 recognized partners from all sectors of society (public, private, nonprofit and community based); created a collective impact scorecard to measure successes; and identified five 
targeted areas of influence to guide and organize partner efforts.  
San Diego County’s recognition that complex issues impacting health, safety and other aspects of a high quality life cannot be addressed by individuals acting in isolation has helped effectively improve air quality, combat obesity rates and increase average life expectancy.”

HiAP: recognizes that personal health behaviors are strongly influenced by the environments where we live, learn, work and play; acknowledges that greater coordination is required to ensure that programs and policies do not produce unintended negative impacts on residents’ health; and offers strategies for cities to reduce inequitable access to healthy food options and safe play spaces for children. By paying attention to the built environment – from land use planning and restaurants, to safe streets and parks – our community can greatly shape the health of our community, and especially our children.

heading-title: "Air"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio continue improving the city’s air quality?"
heading-content: "Air quality in San Antonio and the region has been worsening for several years. Before 2005, Bexar County’s average daily air quality measure far exceeded the state measure. By 2008, the county’s level of fine particulate matter in the air had decreased to 9.1 micrograms per cubic meter. This level was lower than the state’s 10.2 micrograms, but higher than the national benchmark of 8.8. <a href='https://www.sa2020.org/'>SA2020</a> put forth a goal of reducing ozone by 16%. However, our current ozone levels are above the standard.
The City of San Antonio maintains and enforces a pollution control ordinance to address urban air quality. It’s also monitored and governed by the Federal Clean Air Act, which requires states to meet national ambient air quality standards. States must develop plans to achieve and maintain acceptable levels in all areas, and develop specific plans and implement additional programs for those areas designated as not meeting the standard.
There are many steps we can take to improve air quality, especially for car and truck emissions: we can preserve and expand the city’s tree canopy to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or enhance programs and policies such as incentives for electric and hybrid cars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
We can also provide incentives to increase the amount of local renewable energy production. We can develop strategies to increase bicycling, walking and transit ridership. And we can develop new and utilize existing public/private partnership programs to monitor air quality to see how well we’re doing."

introduction-content: "Community services and facilities are vital to our economic prosperity and quality of life. Crime prevention, maintaining reliable energy supplies, schools, parks, flood protection and green infrastructure provide an essential foundation for stable, prosperous communities.  
Failing to plan for the impact of growth on our public facilities is not an option. 
For instance, we know buildings account for over 90% of electricity consumption in San Antonio (compared with 75% nationally). Our community has already begun to implement strategies to improve environmental performance, such as the Mission Verde effort and the Mayor’s task force which provided new building code recommendations. We do not have a large-scale, municipally supported retrofit program. Nor do we have a citywide green infrastructure and stormwater management effort. 
Given that 1.1 million more people will live in the area by 2040, it’s clear that “business as usual” can’t be continued. This growth represents a tremendous opportunity for the San Antonio metropolitan region, but could undermine our quality of life if we do not plan and act appropriately. The Public Facilities and Community Safety (PFCS) goals and polices were developed to meet the six public facilities and community safety challenges for our City that follow."
  
heading-title: "Infrastructure"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio upgrade its infrastructure and public facilities and services to remain economically competitive while supporting healthy, prosperous and safe lives for all its residents?"
heading-content: "To spur economic growth and remain competitive at both a national and international level, San Antonio needs to continually maintain and upgrade our existing infrastructure—roads, bridges, electrical grid, water and sewage systems—incorporating principles of sustainable design. We can strategically use our infrastructure investments as a tool to support our broader urban planning and economic development goals.
The City has identified 13 employment centers that offer an opportunity to create vibrant, mixed-use places; the type of live-work-play environments that attract development and business nationally, but are lacking in San Antonio. We can use infrastructure investments to focus economic activity that will facilitate new development in these priority growth areas. We can also identify and invest retrofitting existing infrastructure to allow for a mixture of uses and facilitate denser development within these regional centers. Major public and private facilities can also be strategically located to serve as an additional catalyst for the development of downtown and other regional centers as destinations of choice for residential and business communities. New neighborhoods and other new developments should then be oriented around the parks, schools, libraries and other public facilities within these growth centers. 
These same investments can also support the growth of San Antonio’s target industries within these centers. These targeted industries include biosciences and scientific R&D, information technology/security, advanced manufacturing and energy. Many of these industries rely on young, highly skilled professionals who will be attracted to the regional centers’ walkable neighborhoods, civic amenities and urban lifestyles. 
To ensure the environmental sustainability and resilience of these growth centers and of San Antonio as a whole, we can promote development that leverages and protects the public’s investment in major green infrastructure and natural resource projects. As a core element of this sustainability program, the City can coordinate stormwater management by upgrading existing infrastructure with green stormwater management solutions. We can also implement stormwater infrastructure management policies that balance well-developed and well-maintained regional infrastructure with site-specific stormwater infrastructure.
Infrastructure investments must also take into account projected population growth to ensure there will be adequate capacity as demand increases. We need to be sure that public facilities and services remain aligned with public needs and expectations. The City can regularly evaluate the capacity and timing of new infrastructure, concurrent with private development. In addition, we can plan how best to expand water treatment and wastewater treatment plants. This will also require partnering with utility providers to regularly update their planning efforts and review processes. Finally, we should also systematically evaluate and identify existing infrastructure that is at or near the end of its lifespan, or that is operating at or above recommended capacity and plan accordingly for replacement or expansion."

In 2008, Portland also launched a Grey to Green Initiative with an initial investment of $50 million in Stormwater Management Fees to support green infrastructure projects including 43 acres of green roofs, 920 green street components, planting over 80,000 trees and purchasing 419 acres of high priority natural areas. 
As green streets projects developed over time, the City realized they had the potential to incorporate elements that achieved other city goals beyond stormwater management. Specifically, green street projects can easily combine natural stormwater management and water quality techniques; provision of neighborhood park and green spaces; and facilities to enhance safety and comfort for walking and biking.
Portland’s integrated, multilayered approach to stormwater management has created a sustainable and scalable application for the City, allowed for multiple goals to be achieved through a singular application, and laid the ground work for a broader regional and state-wide green infrastructure network. In addition, these programs reduced the region’s infrastructure upgrade costs from an estimated $144 million for conventional solutions to $86 million with green infrastructure approaches.”

heading-title: "Emergency Response"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio continue improving emergency response times for fire and police protection and plan for continued provision and improvements in level of service for existing and future growth areas?"
heading-content: "We have made significant progress in improving our emergency response. In one of the early successes, both the San Antonio Fire Department and San Antonio Police Department have reduced emergency response times from 9.4 minutes in 2010 to 7.1 minutes in 2013. The crime rate decreased about 11% from 2010 to 2012. And, in 2014 66% of San Antonio citizens surveyed rated their overall feeling of safety as “excellent” or “good.” 
Public safety officials, City staff, businesses and residents must continue to collaborate through strong, engaged community neighborhood networks to reduce crime and promote a thriving and law-abiding San Antonio. We need proactive crime prevention programs, responsive enforcement efforts and a high state of disaster readiness to achieve and maintain low levels of crime and a high sense of personal safety. 
It will be critically important for San Antonio to maintain our progress with a rapidly expanding population. We can meet this challenge by strategically locating police, fire and emergency medical services in both existing and new growth areas to provide and enhance effective and efficient services and response times. Public safety facilities and services and neighborhood resilience can also be enhanced through efforts such as safety awareness and educational programs, animal control and a focus on other issues impacting neighborhoods."

heading-title: "Schools"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio work with area school districts to improve access to education and educational outcomes?"
heading-content: "The City has identified education as one of its most important challenges. We’ve set a variety of goals for improving educational standards and performance, from kindergarten readiness to high school graduation rates and the number of San Antonio adults with college degrees. Achieving these educational goals will prepare our residents to thrive in a variety of occupations and to respond to the changing needs of the 21st century workplace. 
The results of our efforts so far have been mixed. High school graduation rates have increased 7% since 2010 and are still trending upwards. But, third grade reading proficiency levels declined 3% over a three-year period leading up to 2014. And despite an enormous citywide push to encourage more students to enroll in 2- and 4- year colleges, we are not graduating enough students to meet the demand in the workplace. Of the nation’s largest cities, San Antonio has one of the lowest percentages of adults with college degrees. That number has indeed slightly increased recently. But since college enrollment has not increased, the higher percentage may be due to new arrivals with degrees coming to San Antonio, rather than more local students completing college degrees.
The City can and should play a significant role in promoting educational performance. The effort to improve educational outcomes can also be used to support other important regional goals, such as encouraging development within priority growth areas. For instance, the City can assist area school districts in reserving land for future school sites in planned regional centers and other future growth areas. And, to drive market demand for housing, we can work with school districts to help promote innovative educational opportunities within these priority growth areas. And we can also support existing schools by investing in their surrounding neighborhoods. Finally, by encouraging cooperative, flexible design of school facilities to ensure maximum use, we can also ensure their potential for adaptive reuse as ongoing neighborhood resources. 
To enhance educational performance on a community-wide basis, the City can provide land, facilities and entitlements that can be used to establish schools to attract a broad spectrum of families with children. We can collaborate with and provide support to underperforming independent school districts, including effort-funding increases and support for early childhood education programs."

heading-title: "Energy"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio encourage further increases in renewable energy capacity and energy conservation measures?"
heading-content: "The City of San Antonio’s power is delivered by CPS Energy, a municipally owned energy utility. CPS has a relatively diversified mix of fuels, including 43% natural gas, 28% coal, 14% nuclear and 14% wind. Solar and methane-gas sources account for the remaining 1%. As of December 2013, renewable sources accounted for 14.6% of the region’s generating capacity (1,113 megawatts), up from 9.7% in 2011 and 7.5% in 2009. While the city has grown and increased our energy demand, CPS’s greenhouse gas emissions have declined as a result of increasing use of nuclear and renewable energy. The city reached its <a href='https://www.sa2020.org/'>SA2020</a> goal of having 1,500 MW of renewable energy capacity under contract five years early in 2015. 
CPS’s Save for Tomorrow Energy Plan (STEP) aims to reduce the growth in demand for electricity in the city by 771 megawatts by 2020. This is the equivalent of the output of one large power plant. To achieve this goal, CPS has committed millions of dollars in incentives and rebates for customers. Residents are encouraged to purchase energy-efficient appliances, improve residential HVAC systems and insulation, increase the use of energy-efficient lighting, increase the use of programmable thermostats and expand commercial lighting retrofits. But it is an ongoing challenge to reach lower-income customers and find ways to include renters in the programs.
Between 2008 and 2013, the STEP program reduced over 318 megawatts of energy consumption. To continue this progress requires that we acknowledge that buildings account for over 90% of electricity consumption in San Antonio. The Mission Verde effort, an economic development plan initiated in 2008, recommended strategies to improve the environmental performance of existing buildings through a retrofit program and improve new construction by developing a high-performance development code. The Mayor’s Task Force established guidelines for a new building code that has not yet been adopted. Despite the lack of a consolidated green building effort, San Antonio has over 180 buildings and residences certified under the U.S. Green Building Council’s green building certification program. Build San Antonio Green the City’s residential green building program has certified over 3,500 homes to date. 
Moving forward, the City can set an example by promoting policies and regulations that maximize the energy efficiency of all City buildings and facilities. Next, we can create policies requiring City owned buildings be brought up to green building standards by 2040 and promote and expand weatherization programs for existing buildings. 
The City can also do more to encourage alternative forms of clean energy and expand systems for its provision. This effort can include partnering with utility providers to offer a renewable energy purchase choice and to expand renewable energy rebates programs. We can explore fee waiver programs to encourage renewable energy options in new development. And we can regularly review and revise ordinances regarding energy infrastructure and transmission components."

Built in 2010, CPS Energy has a 30-year agreement to purchase all electricity generated by the site. According to CPS, the 139-acre site generates an estimated 26,570 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity each year. That’s enough to power approximately 1,800 San Antonio area homes annually. Additionally, the emissions-free power generated from the site is equivalent to taking 3,800 cars off the road.”

heading-title: "Zero Waste"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio carry out a program of waste reduction, recycling and reuse to achieve its vision of zero waste?"
heading-content: "The City’s Solid Waste Management Department (SWMD) developed a Recycling and Resource Recovery Plan that outlines a vision for zero waste. It offers strategies and actions to improve waste reduction and recycling programs through education and outreach, incentives and regulatory changes. According to SWMD, an average single-family household in San Antonio generates about eight pounds of waste every day. 
Recycling rates have increased so that, despite population growth, we are now sending less waste to landfills. After instituting automated recycling services and other improvements to make recycling more convenient for residents, household recycling increased almost four-fold, to 29% of the residential waste stream by 2014. The City’s goal is to increase the single-family residential recycling rate to 60% by 2025. Since the adoption of the Recycling and Resource Recovery Plan in 2010, the Department has reduced annual landfill waste from 444,000 tons to 362,000 tons, an 18% reduction.
To move closer to fulfilling the zero waste vision, the City can establish regulations to minimize waste generation through effective waste reduction, reuse and recycling. We can also take the lead by prioritizing use of as many recycled materials as possible for all City facilities and programs."

heading-title: "Parks"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio develop its park and recreation system to ensure that every neighborhood is within walking distance of a park, trail or other open space?"
heading-content: "The City of San Antonio operates and maintains 257 parks covering 15,469 acres of land, with more than 100 miles of trails. Park facilities include playgrounds, trails, fitness equipment stations, pools, gyms, sports facilities, recreation centers and the Botanical Garden and Conservatory. 
Park acreage in 2014 was 18 acres per 1,000 residents, which compares favorably with the national average. But as the city has grown, we haven’t increased park space. The 2014 figure is a decrease from 2010, when the rate was 20.7 acres per 1,000 residents. We will need to build many more new parks to keep pace with our population. 
It’s also true that there’s an uneven distribution of numbers of parks and sizes of parks in the region. Park acreage is especially slim in the west and southwest portions of San Antonio, where there are only 3.0 and 5.1 acres per 1,000 residents respectively. As a consequence, in 2013 only 33% of the population lived within a walkable distance to a park.
We will need to enhance our efforts to reduce park disparities, while maintaining an acceptable park acreage ratio, especially in underserved areas. This effort should be guided by recommendations from the Parks and Recreation System Strategic Plan. In light of the uneven distribution, we also need to review and amend current park dedication requirements in the Unified Development Code (UDC) to ensure they yield the type and size of parks the city wants."

  content: “The Minneapolis Parks System spans 6,790 acres of parkland and water, and features 251 park properties, over 200 miles of paths, 22 lakes, 12 formal gardens and 47 recreation centers. The City’s investment in parks and open space helped it earn the first-ever “five park bench” rating on The Trust for Public Land’s ParkScore® index, finishing first among the 50 largest U.S. cities. Minneapolis scored especially high marks for park accessibility and park system investment. Yet despite the City’s strong commitment to the park system, equitable distribution of open spaces and the quality of park and open space resources in lower-income communities remains a City concern. 
The main avenue for addressing the equitable distribution and investment in its parks is the semi-independent Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board (MPRB). The MPRB works to mitigate disparity by emphasizing equity as one of three cornerstones of system sustainability; utilizing system-wide planning to identify and address existing service gaps; and using growth projections to identify areas which will require new or enhanced services. 
MPRB’s commitment to equitable park and open space planning has made Minneapolis a leader in providing physical, social and environmental benefits to all its residents and communities.”

title: "Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability"
abbreviation: "NRES"
lead-copy: "A sustainable community aligns its built environment and socioeconomic activities with nature’s constraints and opportunities. Central to this concept is meeting our present and future needs by balancing protection of the environment and ongoing prosperity of the local economy. The two components are interrelated and equally important—one component should not succeed at the expense of the other."
introduction-content: "The degree to which a city’s urban form is compact, mixed-use, pedestrian and bicycle-friendly and transit-oriented influences its travel patterns and vehicle miles traveled, public health and safety, emergency preparedness and access to housing and economic opportunity. San Antonio’s sustainability planning work to date has included considerations of both our transportation and our land use networks. In particular, the Mission Verde retrofit plan and the Neighborhood Sustainability Assessment provide a strong framework. San Antonio achieved a Neighborhood Sustainability Assessment median score of 40/100, with the downtown area scoring highest. Not surprisingly, neighborhoods with denser housing and development achieve higher index scores than those with low-density, suburban-style development patterns. 
In 2014, the City adopted the nation’s first Green Event Guide Ordinance, requiring events on City-owned property to complete a “green scorecard” for certification and consider measures to reduce water and energy use, generate less waste and increase recycling. Other key City accomplishments include a Farm to Work program to help City employees receive farm fresh produce and working with Staples to establish eco-conscious purchasing policies and practices. The City’s upcoming Sustainability Plan will include recommendations, strategies and actions to further reduce the city’s greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption.
Several key issues will define San Antonio’s successful approach to natural resources and environmental sustainability during the next 25 years."
  
heading-title: "Natural Resources"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio protect and responsibly use its natural resources?"
heading-content: "As a community we will need to commit to preserving, protecting, conserving, reusing and efficiently using San Antonio’s natural resources to ensure they will be available for current and future residents. An ample and reliable supply of clean, safe water, sufficient energy supplies and the full diversity of natural resources will contribute to the physical and psychological health and well-being of the community and strengthen the vitality of our local and regional economic base. 
Our City has established itself as a leader in urban sustainability. We have developed innovative policies, programs and partnerships that guide municipal and community actions to support resource conservation and sustainable behavior. But as we grow, we must recommit ourselves to ensuring San Antonio remains a sustainable community.
San Antonio has over 180 buildings and residences certified under the U.S. Green Building Council's green building certification program. “Build San Antonio Green” is San Antonio's local residential green building program certifying over 3,500 homes to date. The City itself continues to “green” its municipal operations under the leadership of the Office of Sustainability, ensuring efficient operations that minimize environmental impact and resource use. However, there is no large-scale, city-wide retrofit, energy efficiency, green building or green infrastructure program. 
The City will need to incorporate sustainable principles into our everyday actions and decisions, monitoring progress and adapting to changing conditions and new information. City land use policies will need to increasingly promote compact, walkable, mixed-use development, infill development and redevelopment, protect open space and agricultural lands, and encourage a jobs and housing balance. The City’s transportation policies will call for improved connectivity between neighborhoods, jobs and services, street design that accommodates all modes of transportation and reduces idling time, reduced parking requirements and sustainable transportation modes. This sustainable policy direction will occur while fostering a positive climate for economic development. 
Beyond the City’s civic efforts are those that will need to be spearheaded by the San Antonio community. Residents, businesses, community groups, schools and other organizations all need to be engaged and actively participating in the effort to create a socially, environmentally and economically healthy community. The City must be an effective leader and partner in sustainability efforts. Participation in larger scale sustainability efforts is critical because local environmental and economic issues are a part of a broader regional, national and global context."
  
heading-title: "Water"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio ensure an adequate and safe drinking water supply?
How can we reduce demand for water?"
heading-content: "Nothing is more integral to sustaining human life than clean, safe water. We depend on it for our basic needs. We also need a reliable supply for irrigation and for commercial, industrial and recreational uses. As we grow, we will need additional water supplies; insufficient supplies can stunt local housing and economic development. Historically, San Antonio has relied almost entirely on a single source of water, the Edwards Aquifer. Encompassing an area of 8 counties across south-central Texas, including San Antonio and our surrounding communities, the Edwards Aquifer is the main water supply source for the region and provides water flows for endangered species habitat. 
In 2000, San Antonio passed the first voter-supported aquifer protection program to help safeguard the city’s primary source of drinking water, the Edwards Aquifer. Funded by a 1/8-cent sales tax, the Aquifer Protection Program has been renewed by voters three times, in 2005, 2010 and again in 2015. The Program has resulted in the protection of over 135,000 acres of land located over the sensitive recharge and contributing zones of the aquifer to date.
The San Antonio Water System (SAWS) has diversified its water sources to reduce reliance on the Edwards Aquifer with new sources such as the Twin Oaks Aquifer Storage and Recovery plant that stores water underground for peak use or during droughts. The SAWS Water Management Plan also lays out an ambitious program to expand the water supply by over 69,000 additional acre-feet of water annually by 2020 and over 100,000 acre-feet of water annually by 2026.
The city also benefits from the largest direct water recycling program in the nation. More than 130 miles of pipeline delivers high-quality recycled water for use by golf courses, parks, commercial and industrial customers, as well as San Antonio's famous River Walk. The system can provide up to 25,000 acre-feet per year, further reducing demand on the Edwards Aquifer.
Water conservation is a cost-effective and environmentally sound way to reduce how much water we need. Residents and business owners can use water-conserving fixtures and appliances, fix leaks, plant drought-tolerant landscaping and avoid unnecessary water use.
Through water management planning, diversification of supply and an award-winning conservation program, San Antonio has made great strides towards developing a sustainable supply of water. Since the inception of the City’s conservation program in 1993, per capita water use has generally declined over time, although it does increase during particularly dry years. 
The City also needs to ensure the quality of the community’s drinking water. Water contamination can come from various sources, including soil erosion, runoff from impervious surfaces and discharge from agricultural activities. We can reduce the impact on water quality in several ways: using proper management practices for agricultural, livestock, industrial, and commercial operations; reducing or eliminating excess sediment, nutrients and pathogens in upstream waters; requiring new development to use best management practices; and enforcing septic tank regulations
The SAWS water quality protection program is one of the most aggressive in the state. SAWS implements policies that prevent, detect and reduce environmental pollution in our drinking water supplies, streams and rivers by:
Ensuring water quality of the Edwards Aquifer is protected;
Enforcing the regulatory requirements established to protect regional water quality;
Reviewing and analyzing development plans over the recharge zone of the Edwards Aquifer;
Monitoring best management practices at construction sites;
Utilizing an extensive sampling and monitoring network for compliance purposes;
Educating industries on the Storm Water Program; and
Funding a Sensitive Land Acquisition Program to protect water quality on the recharge zone.
While our water resources are currently adequate, the City still faces challenges related to regulations, extreme weather and demand for water associated with outdoor irrigation. To continue meeting the needs of population increases, economic growth and competing regional demands, San Antonio’s water resources must be effectively managed through a combination of conservation, supply development and other practices to support growth and sustainability."

heading-title: "Energy"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio be a leader in energy conservation?"
heading-content: "Knowing where we get our energy supplies—particularly those sources that are nonrenewable—and understanding the consequences associated with energy waste will help us use energy more efficiently. 
Our most common forms of energy are coal and natural gas to create electricity and heat, and petroleum (gasoline) for transportation. When we harness energy through burning fossil fuels, greenhouse gases are released into the environment. Energy use (in buildings, for transportation or elsewhere) is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions in San Antonio as it is in most U.S. cities. Global climate change is caused by greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere faster than the Earth’s natural systems can reabsorb them. 
Increasing renewable energy production and decreasing energy consumption through land use policy and energy conservation practices can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the Earth’s climate change. 
Residents, the business community and institutions can use less energy through simple conservation techniques. The City can provide incentives and programs that promote energy conservation, increased production of renewable energy sources, expand incentives and requirements for green building standards and encourage further investment in energy conservation education and incentives.
The City can serve as an example through a municipal energy reduction program; the new Energy Management Division (EMD) oversees efforts to maximize water and energy efficiency in City-owned buildings and facilities. Municipal operations, however, represent only a small percentage of the total electricity and natural gas used throughout the city—community-wide efforts are essential to achieving overall reductions in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. 
Buildings account for over 90% of electricity consumption in San Antonio. The City’s ability to influence energy efficiency in existing buildings will be critical to achieving our sustainability goals. However, a large-scale municipally supported retrofit program has yet to be implemented. Similarly, green infrastructure efforts are concentrated in a handful of programs and are often driven by nonprofit advocacy organizations rather than institutionalized by the City. 
Another significant way to conserve energy use is to reduce automobile use and the related vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The City can use regulatory authority in important areas like land use, building and transportation policy. As a result, San Antonio endorses land use and transportation policies and practices that encourage compact, mixed-use, pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly and transit-oriented development. These policies influence travel patterns and reduce vehicle miles traveled."

heading-title: "Stormwater"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio best address flooding issues and stormwater management?"
heading-content: "Flooding has plagued the San Antonio River Basin for generations. As recently as 2015, we experienced major flooding in the Upper San Antonio River watershed, which was felt throughout Bexar, Wilson, Karnes and Goliad counties. Floods can occur in various ways. Some develop slowly, when rain continues over a period of days and inundates water systems. Some, like flash floods, occur in a matter of minutes when a levee or dam is breached. Every year brings the potential for serious flooding. 
Bexar Regional Watershed Management (BRWM) has been working to identify areas in Bexar County where there are major flooding issues. It has invested significant resources to develop new planning and technical tools, initiate comprehensive watershed and water quality studies and construct projects to address flooding concerns and improve safety. 
San Antonio has developed a public education program called the SAFE (San Antonio Flood Emergency) System to educate the public about flood awareness and preparedness. 
On a more local level, we need to deal with urban stormwater, rainfall that has fallen onto our streets, roofs and driveways and other paved surfaces. Rainwater runoff picks up bacteria, toxins, oils, hydrocarbons, sediment, metals, fertilizers and other contaminants and deposits them right into our creeks and rivers. In San Antonio, stormwater does not drain into a sewer system to be treated as we treat wastewater. 
The San Antonio River Authority (SARA) water quality monitoring data shows that pollutants carried by stormwater runoff are the greatest threat to our creek and river health. That water flows all the way to San Antonio Bay, with direct effect on the health of wildlife in the Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.
The City’s Regional Storm Water Management Program was established to protect public health and safety by requiring developers to mitigate increases in stormwater runoff that result from development projects. Because impervious, paved surfaces have replaced most of the natural ground cover in our urban environments, a great stormwater control measure is low impact development (LID).
LID is an innovative stormwater management approach, modeled after nature. Rather than sending stormwater rushing into rivers, it mimics the natural environment, holding and cleansing water on site through natural filtration. 
In San Antonio, stormwater management efforts are concentrated in a handful of programs and are often driven by nonprofit advocacy organizations rather than institutionalized in the city. SARA and its BRWM partners have developed a LID design manual to proactively address water quality and water resource protection in the San Antonio River Basin. These efforts work towards preserving natural watershed functions that manage the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff through a balance of economic, environmental and quality of life considerations. 
Maintaining water quality is important to public health, wildlife and economic prosperity, and is a requirement of the federal Clean Water Act. A combination of increasing water quality regulations, aging infrastructure, a growing population and increased urbanization require that the City adopt a more holistic approach to solve flooding and environmental issues from stormwater events."

  title: "Key Principles of Low-Impact Development"
  content: “LID is based on the premise that stormwater management is not stormwater disposal; in fact, stormwater can be a reusable asset. LID addresses stormwater through small, cost-effective landscape features located at the lot level. The goal is to mimic a site's original, natural hydrology by using design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate and cleanse runoff close to its source, rather than sending it directly to the storm drain system in large, costly end-of-pipe facilities. Key principles include:
Decentralize and manage urban runoff to integrate water management throughout the watershed;
Preserve or restore an ecosystem’s natural hydrological functions and cycles;
Account for a site’s topographic features in its design;
Reduce impervious (paved) ground cover and the building footprint;
Maximize infiltration on-site; and
If infiltration is not possible, then capture water for filtration and/or reuse for irrigation.”

heading-title: "Air"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio improve its air quality?"
heading-content: "Chief among our environmental concerns is the impact of human actions and choices on the atmosphere. With the emergence of the industrial age, human activity began to release increasing amounts of pollutants, carbon dioxide and other harmful gases into the atmosphere, largely through burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The elevated levels of harmful gases and pollutants create two key concerns: compromised local air quality and a global “greenhouse” effect that has resulted in changing the Earth’s atmosphere. 
Air quality in San Antonio has been steadily getting worse for several years, climbing to 81 parts per billion in 2013 from the baseline of 75 parts per billion in 2010. This number declined slightly in 2014 to 80 parts per billion, but we are still significantly off target from our goal of 68 parts per billion by 2020. To comply with federal policy on air quality, which was put in place to protect the environment and community health, we must be more proactive about local solutions and incentives to improve air quality. 
Good air quality in San Antonio contributes to good health, which benefits families and businesses (in terms of fewer sick days). While air quality is a regional issue addressed by State and regional regulatory agencies, the City has an obligation to contribute to regional efforts to improve air quality. The City’s Air Pollution Program monitors the ambient air in San Antonio and we maintain and enforce a pollution control ordinance. The program monitors for particulate matter 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5) and particulate matter 10 microns in size (PM10). These small particles could cause respiratory problems for small children, the elderly and the general public. The program also operates and maintains an ozone monitor located at Calaveras Lake for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).
How we design the built environment can have a significant effect on our air quality. Since motor vehicles are a major air pollution source, urban designs that decrease private automobile use could improve air quality and decrease air pollution related health risks. The City’s plans to meet and exceed state and federal air quality standards rely on control measures that reduce emissions associated with transportation facilities. 
These measures include any program to reduce vehicle trips and miles traveled, to increase average vehicle ridership, or to reduce direct emissions from vehicle activity. 
San Antonio’s sustainability planning work has also included considerations of its transportation and land use networks. The challenge moving forward is to persuade San Antonio residents to drive less. To do that, we must change the way we plan, develop and manage our communities to make it easier and more attractive for people to use transit, bicycle or walk."

  content: “Urban areas are subject to much higher rates of pollution and poorer air quality than rural areas, threatening the health of residents. To mitigate the effects of air pollution, the Baltimore, MD has heavily invested in and set an ambitious goal of 40% for Tree Canopy coverage over the city. The Baltimore Metropolitan Area has about 2.8 million trees, but about one-fourth of the city’s trees are distressed, dead or dying. To reach its goal, Baltimore must plant approximately 750,000 trees — about 25,000 to 30,000 each year. Currently, about 7,500 are planted per year. Spearheading these planting goals is a coordinated effort between the City and nonprofit organizations. TreeBaltimore, a city-led partnership funded in part by corporate donations, was established in 2007 and is headed by the Baltimore City Department of Recreation and Parks Forestry Division. TreeBaltimore serves as the umbrella organization for all City agencies and private organizations working to increase the tree canopy of Baltimore. To achieve the 40% goal, it offers free one-gallon trees for homes and businesses every Spring and Fall, fosters community engagement and public education programs and invests in restoration of the existing tree canopy. 
Baltimore’s commitment to its tree canopy will create a more sustainable and healthy future for all its current and future residents.”

heading-questions: "How can we increase recycling and minimize waste sent to landfills?"
heading-content: "Recycling is an important component in San Antonio’s future – we have set a goal of achieving a zero waste vision. To accomplish this, we must establish regulations to minimize waste and promote reuse and recycling. Refer to Public Facilities Goal 6 for a more in depth discussion of achieving a zero waste vision. 
The City’s goal is to increase the single-family residential recycling rate to 60% by 2025. We have begun to offer single-family residences the choice of three garbage cart options: 48-gallon; 69-gallon; and 96-gallon. Residents’ monthly bills will be based on the size of their garbage cart thereby encouraging households to recycle and reduce their waste. We will also work to ensure that residents living in multifamily properties have convenient and accessible recycling services and partner with businesses to improve recycling in the commercial sector."

  content: “In 2009, the City of San Francisco passed an ordinance mandating the composting of food waste. The ordinance is part of the City’s larger goal of reaching zero waste by 2020. In 2011, San Francisco composted a record 600 tons of organic waste per day. In 2012, it was announced that 80% of San Francisco’s waste is diverted to recycling, composting, and reuse, making it the greenest city in North America. To achieve its 2020 goal of zero waste, the City has implemented a strategic waste reduction, education, and recycling and compost plan which utilizes innovative recycling and reuse programs and policies. 
A few of these policies include: the sale of locally made compost to farms and wineries in neighboring counties; a Christmas Tree Recycling program where chipped trees are turned into broiler fuel at waste to energy facilities; and an ordinance outlawing plastic bags and bottles. 
By focusing on preventing waste, reducing and reusing first, and recycling and composting, San Francisco is quickly becoming not only a national leader, but a world leader with its zero waste initiative.”

title: "Historic Preservation and Cultural Heritage"
abbreviation: "HPCH"
lead-copy: "San Antonio’s wealth of historic and cultural resources tell the 11,000-year story of our city’s long and diverse past. Our heritage, both tangible and intangible, reflects America’s melting pot of ideas, traditions and peoples."
introduction-content: "We recognize the importance of this diverse and culturally significant history and want to ensure its continued preservation.  
To do so we must maintain and support our historic neighborhoods, reinvest in our historic buildings and sites, perpetuate our cultural heritage, and invest in on our UNESCO World Heritage Site and buffer zone. By working together, we can protect San Antonio’s identity and ensure an inclusive and sustainable historic and cultural future for our community.  
As a city rich in history and culture, we recognize the opportunity to invest in our historic resources and enhance the character and quality of life in our city. Historic preservation has proven economic and social benefits at the local level, and we look forward to providing new opportunities and incentives for those who are interested in investing in the historic building fabric that makes San Antonio unique.
To fully realize these opportunities, we must also acknowledge several challenges that require a collaborative community approach: consistent pressure from new development, balancing preservation of neighborhood character with healthy growth and addressing perceptions that preservation is onerous and expensive. 
Along with property owners and stakeholders, we must work to increase clarity and consistency in our historic preservation policies and procedures. We must promote the benefits and opportunities that preservation provides to property owners, stakeholders, decision makers and key organizations. We must also be open to discussions with our residents on ways to improve cultural and historic preservation processes and overall effectiveness.
The City needs to ensure that the identification, designation and protection of historic and cultural resources are an integral part of our community planning, development, and permitting processes. The Historic Preservation and Cultural Heritage (HPCH) goals and policies meet six key historic preservation and cultural heritage issues for our city."
  
heading-title: "Policies and Procedures"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio best sustain and protect the historic and cultural identity of the city?"
heading-content: "Historic structures and landscapes are important, tangible reminders of the city’s rich and diverse cultural heritage. They provide a sense of our past and contribute in many ways to our quality of life. Yet, urban growth and new development pose threats to many of these heritage resources. 
The City has developed many programs and inducements aimed at protecting and preserving these resources such as the new historic district tax incentive and a tax incentive to reward substantial rehabilitation. Additionally, Federal and State programs provide property owners with financial incentives and offer cities preservation tools. We need to work with residents to guide them through these processes and ensure that all our residents have access to these tools. 
The City can ensure that the development review and permitting process is clear and transparent, and easily processed by the public. We must strengthen outreach to clarify procedures and protocols and streamline the permitting process as much as possible. These processes and procedures, along with the formal policies and strategies, should be regularly evaluated to ensure they are meeting citywide goals and measurable targets. 
San Antonio’s Preservation Program
San Antonio’s Office of Historic Preservation (OHP) coordinates our historic preservation program to protect the historic, cultural, architectural, and archaeological resources that make San Antonio unique. The Historic Preservation section of our Unified Development Code (UDC) outlines the local historic designation process, the roles and responsibilities of the Historic and Design Review Commission (HDRC), the design review process and other regulatory tools and requirements. 
Historic Survey and Designation
The designation of individual landmarks and historic districts is a zoning overlay that is an effective tool for preserving the character and aesthetic of important sites and neighborhoods. Designation of properties protects them from hasty demolition and promotes alterations and new construction that is compatible with the landmark or the district. The comprehensive survey and designation initiative known as ScoutSA works to proactively identify significant resources and designate those that the community wishes to protect. 
Design Review
New construction, additions, modifications, signage, and other site elements must follow our historic preservation design guidelines when the property is designated a historic site or the property is within one of our 27 historic districts. The guidelines give property and business owners direction for how to preserve and maintain the character and use of historic structures, while allowing for necessary upgrades required by current building and safety regulations. The intent of the guidelines is to provide additional clarity, consistency, and predictability to the design review process. 
Education and Outreach
OHP established the Preservation Academy to host training, workshops, events, and other activities to promote the value and importance of preservation in the community and to provide citizens with tools and resources to maintain historic properties. Outreach initiatives include youth education programming and service-learning opportunities through Students Together Achieving Revitalization (S.T.A.R.). The Rehabber Club initiative also provides technical training and certification for contractors and other preservation trade practitioners in topics such as window restoration. 
Additional Zoning Overlays
The River Improvement Overlay, Viewshed Protection districts, the Mission Protection Overlay District, aim to protect and enhance the overall character of the San Antonio River and safeguard San Antonio's heritage by preventing the despoliation of views of areas and buildings that reflect important elements of the city's cultural, natural, historic and economic fabric.
Archaeological Surveys
Since the city has seen human habitation since the last phase of the Pleistocene, over 11,200 years ago, there is definite potential for historic resources to exist both above and hidden below ground. We provide direction to developers in specific areas of the city where potential projects require Archaeological Surveys to identify and preserve cultural resources. If the site might contain significant cultural resources, we advise on the appropriate next steps and necessary actions required."

heading-content: "Cultural heritage is the reflection of our legacy through physical artifacts and intangible characteristics inherited from our ancestors and passed down from generation to generation. It includes tangible assets like our UNESCO World Heritage Site and intangible resources such as spiritual and culinary customs, traditions and languages. 
In order to document and preserve our extensive and significant heritage, we must continue to engage in mapping and identifying sites, customs, languages, traditions, places and people. While this is easily accomplished with tangible sites and landmarks, we must work to strengthen our database of intangible assets. 
By working with our residents we can recognize and protect intangible heritage resources through oral histories and cultural mapping. By creating a cultural map, we can transform our intangible heritage and customs into a physical and visual tool that establishes places in our community where important traditions take place. "

To better understand and assess the site’s history and extant resources the City commissioned a Cultural Landscape Inventory (CLI). 
A CLI is a versatile document that provides the stewards of the Civic Center Historic District a valuable reference which enriches people’s knowledge of the history of the site, deepens the understanding of surviving features and whether they contribute to the historic character of the district and provides an understanding of the district’s significance. 
A CLI is a guiding document more than a prescriptive one; it is a resource that directs and manages decisions rather than making them outright. It culls historic and current information, bringing it all together in one place and providing a database, analysis and framework for future decisions affecting the Civic Center Historic District.”

Interactive tour itineraries, maps, photo galleries, virtual tours, GPS tours and mobile activities can target the growing cultural heritage tourism segment, engaging and educating residents and visitors about our historic resources. 
Preserving our history and learning about our culture teaches us and our children about our past and brings us closer to our ancestors. The future of San Antonio’s historic and cultural districts and landmarks rests upon educating younger generations about their importance and value. Historic places provide authentic and interactive experiences, making them valuable learning tools for educators and students.

heading-questions: "How can San Antonio most effectively encourage the continued utilization and value of historic resources through strategic updates and adaptive reuse?"
heading-content: "Adaptive reuse refers to remodeling an existing building to accommodate a new use or purpose other than what it was initially designed for. Particularly in the downtown core, adaptive reuse can be an important element in land conservation and reducing urban sprawl. Additionally, many sustainable features can be found in historic buildings, including passive heating and cooling as a result of site orientation and natural ventilation, natural daylight and use of durable local materials. Reusing existing buildings saves energy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding new construction and diverts demolition waste from landfills. 
The City has developed incentive programs for adaptive reuse projects in eligible areas. The City will continue to work with community partners to seek financial resources and incentivize opportunities for adaptive reuse projects, as well as continue to identify and evaluate procedural incentives."

The San Antonio Museum of Art building in downtown was formerly the Lone Star Brewery complex, built between 1895 and 1905. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Through a multimillion-dollar renovation, the facility transitioned into a museum in 1981. Another successful example is the 13-story Medical Arts Building, built in 1924. The high-rise building included a hospital and housed the offices of doctors and dentists.”

  content: “Downtown Los Angeles is the central business district of the City of Los Angeles and the urban core of the greater metropolitan area. In the early 1900’s, Downtown Los Angeles was a hub of employment activity. However, by the 1990’s, the city center lacked a significant number of residents and had a large stock of vacant older office buildings. To help combat continued decline, the City approved the Adaptive Reuse Ordinance in 1999. 
The ordinance allows for the conversion of existing buildings into residential and live/work units; provides an expedited approval process and ensures that older and historic building are not subjected to the same zoning and code requirements that apply to new construction; and has created a clear direction for developers in dealing with the mechanical, plumbing and structural concerns in redeveloping older buildings for 21st century uses. 
The ordinance resulted in a complete rejuvenation of Downtown. The resident population increased from 27,849 in 2000, to 52,400 in 2014, a 94% increase. Downtown Los Angeles is now a thriving economic and social hub for the region, home to corporate headquarters from a variety of industries, and a sought after location for sporting, social and cultural events.”

heading-title: "The Missions"
heading-questions: "How can the City best promote and protect the World Heritage Missions of San Antonio?"
heading-content: "Preserving culturally and scientifically important resources has always been an issue of global importance. When the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was created in 1945, part of its mission was to develop intercultural understanding through the preservation of culturally and historically significant sites. To date, UNESCO has designated 1,031 properties as World Heritage sites including sites such as Grand Canyon National Park, the Statue of Liberty, Machu Picchu, and Stonehenge.
In 2015, the San Antonio Missions were added to the list of 802 UNESCO World Heritage Cultural sites. This is a tremendous achievement for our community. It is the result of over nine years of coordinated effort and we should be proud of this great honor and distinction. 
The Missions (see details on page 15.11) are recognized based on their cultural importance (Cultural Criteria ii) and outstanding universal value to the world. They demonstrate an interweaving of Spanish, Coahuiltecan and other indigenous peoples in the San Antonio River Basin area. They also demonstrate such characteristics as the integration of indigenous natural art with decorative elements of the Catholic Church and provide post-secularization evidence and a shared value system that transcends the church’s rule. 
Our community takes very seriously the protection of these sites and our mission to address appropriate development around the Missions to preserve their character and enhance their economic prosperity. In 2013, Bexar County commissioned a study of the economic impacts of World Heritage designation for the San Antonio Missions, concluding that the designation would result in a range of 11 to 26% higher economic impacts. The City and its partners must make continued investments with these goals in mind. The recognition of the Missions as a UNESCO World Heritage site, while culturally significant for our area, does present challenges and long term maintenance requirements. These challenges and requirements affect multiple parties involved in management of the Missions including the City, State of Texas (owns the Alamo property), the Archdiocese of San Antonio (owns and operates the 4 remaining missions) and the US National Park Service (manages all property within the San Antonio Missions National Historic Park). These entities must work together to continually update management plans for the Missions, set up and maintain an accurate reporting system on the state of conservation, and work to increase the public’s awareness of the Missions and the greater conservation effort. The established coordinating committee will continue to implement and strengthen its work plan for the Missions, addressing issues such as land use, infrastructure and marketing. 
The long-term sustainability of the San Antonio Missions is an issue of cultural importance not only for San Antonio but for the world. The City will continue to work with both the community and the Missions to create a sense of shared responsibility and pride thereby ensuring future support and sustainability of the various sites. Additionally, continued discussions and partnerships between the US National Park Service, the Archdiocese of San Antonio, the State of Texas and other local and regional organizations is critical to maintaining the Missions and attracting and educating the one million plus visitors to the Missions annually."

title: "Military"
abbreviation: "M"
lead-copy: "As a major employer and actor in the greater San Antonio-New Braunfels metropolitan area, the military and its multiple assets, including Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) and Camp Stanley, provide important employment, economic and partnership opportunities for our city."
introduction-content: "Despite these varied and extensive benefits, there are also challenges that the City and military must work together to address. We have a long and distinguished history as “Military City, USA” and continue to engage active service members and veterans in City decisions. With future base closures and realignments always a looming possibility, proactive steps to strengthen the viability of these installations as an integral part of the city and the region are critical.
JBSA, the largest base organization in the Department of Defense, is made up of 55,760 active duty personnel and 31,624 civilians/contractors.  JBSA is comprised of the following: 
JBSA-Fort Sam Houston: Medical Training, Patient Care, Headquarters;
JBSA-Lackland: Basic & Technical Training;
JBSA-Randolph: Instructor Pilot, Navigator & Instrument Flight Training; and
JBSA-Camp Bullis: Base Operations Support and Training Support to Joint Base San Antonio Mission.  
Our commitment to work with the military and support service members, veterans, and their families will contribute substantially to not only the economic success of our city, but also the health and wellbeing of all its current and future residents.    
By partnering with the military we have the opportunity to enhance our economic performance, strengthen our position as a welcoming military community and advance research and innovative businesses that will distinguish our City in the future. By addressing land use compatibility problems through cooperative land use planning efforts we foster a supportive environment for military operations. The City of San Antonio has already established itself as “Military City, USA.” To protect this legacy, we must work with the military to ensure only safe and compatible development occurs near our military installations. Several key issues will define San Antonio’s successful approach to its partnership with the military over the next 25 years."
  
heading-title: "Land Use and Military Integration"
heading-questions: "How can the City continue to attract and retain military locations, assets and missions?
How can the City address infrastructure limitations near Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) locations, including road capacity and traffic congestion?"
heading-content: "A Joint Land Use Study (JLUS) is a cooperative land use planning effort conducted as a joint venture between an active military installation, surrounding cities and counties, state and federal agencies and other affected stakeholders. 
Three of the military facilities in or near San Antonio have conducted or are in the process of conducting a JLUS. These include studies for JBSA-Camp Bullis, JBSA-Lackland and JBSA-Randolph. Each of these studies provides:
A detailed land use assessment for surrounding high growth areas;
A baseline of existing incompatible land uses around the installation;
Assessments of regional growth trends along designated transportation corridors;
A plan to assist surrounding communities with decision-making; and
Recommendations and strategies to promote compatible land use planning around the military installation and surrounding communities.
The effect of implementing JLUS recommendations has led to increased levels of cooperation and communication and shifted the tone and language of the dialogue regarding the interaction of military and community uses. The prevalence of encroachment issues is gradually giving way to an increased focus on encouraging compatible land uses in the future. Furthermore, there seems to be a new emphasis and commitment to planning for better integration of military installations, activities, personnel, families and veterans into the city fabric. 
In addition, we should collaborate with potential developers, realtors and homeowners to identify areas of compatible development and work with them to integrate affordable housing, desired services and other appropriate uses. 
We must also collaborate with military installations to understand potential issues affecting mission readiness and military quality of life. When possible, City projects and investments should be aligned with needs on and surrounding JBSA facilities. Road construction and investments to manage congestion on major roads leading to installations is one example; SAWS collaboration on water projects to ensure reliable supply to base is another.
Finally, active engagement by the City’s Office of Military Affairs and other task forces and commissions is also crucial to maintaining the success of  San Antonio’s military missions. Cities that actively address legislative and regulatory issues at the state and national levels can ward off situations that may compromise military installations and missions, protecting their ability to maintain or even gain missions if future rounds of Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) occur.
The City of San Antonio has established a Military Transformation Task Force (MTTF), tri-chaired by members of the City of San Antonio, Bexar County and the business community. The mission of the MTTF is to foster communication between the military and the community, enhance mission readiness, sustainability and infrastructure, advocate for the military at the local, state and national levels, and evaluate the impact of any Department of Defense reductions."

  title: "Supporting Infrastructure and Connectivity: Fort McPherson, East Point, Georgia"
  content: “In 2011 Fort McPherson, the seventh largest employer in the Atlanta metro area, closed during the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, resulting in a loss of 9,600 direct and indirect jobs. Despite years of advanced knowledge of the closure, the 486-acre site sat vacant and in poor condition until a 330-acre portion was bought in 2015 to be used as a film studio lot. Even though the City and County put forward their best efforts, the site provided challenges which severely impacted its functionality and future usability. Namely, the site was boxed in by transportation infrastructure (highways and railway tracks) that largely eliminated pedestrian access; is surrounded by a high blight and unemployment area with many vacant buildings and a lack of amenities; and required expensive upgrades to its road, electrical, power and water networks. 
While each military installation and city is different, the case of Fort McPherson offers valuable lessons. Importantly, cities must recognize the immense land use and infrastructure challenges posed by large base closures. Advanced planning, investment and coordination are required by the City, military, and other municipal partners to address infrastructure (water, power) and connectivity (roads, transit) issues that will help the former base successfully integrate into the city’s fabric.”

heading-title: "Encroachment"
heading-questions: "How can San Antonio and the military work to mitigate encroachment issues that pre-date the Joint Land Use Studies (JLUS)?
How can the City’s policies and ordinances proactively address current and potential future land use compatibility issues and avoid costlier retrofit solutions in the future?"
heading-content: "The primary challenge associated with the military presence in San Antonio is the issue of encroachment, or the potential impact of the built environment and development activities that can compromise military mission training requirements or mission readiness. Many encroachment issues have been addressed by Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) between the City and military installations, based on the recommendations of the various Joint Land Use Studies (JLUS).
Zoning overlay districts and other policies and ordinances are used to regulate or limit development within defined Military Influence Areas (MIAs) and in order to help ensure land use compatibility of 
future development. 
The three most critical issues identified in the JBSA-Lackland JLUS include communication and coordination, noise and light and future land use. The JLUS includes several strategies to address these issues.
The three most critical issues identified for JBSA-Camp Bullis are light and glare; threatened and endangered species; and noise and safety. The JLUS for JBSA-Camp Bullis includes several strategies to address these issues including a Military Influence Overlay District as a proposed zoning tool to implement policies and regulations associated with a Military Influence Area. We have also implemented both a Sound Attenuation Overlay (MSAO) and a Lighting Overlay (MLOD/Dark Sky) around Camp Bullis to address light and noise issues. 
The goal of the JBSA-Randolph JLUS is to reduce potential conflicts between the military’s training mission and the surrounding areas while also accommodating growth and economic development, sustaining economic vitality, protecting public health and safety and protecting the operational missions of the installation.  
Other common issues identified include vertical obstruction concerns, traffic congestion around the bases, and encroachment into the MIA.
The military continues to provide valuable guidance and resources even after the JLUS reports are completed. An Installation Complex Encroachment Management Action Plan (ICEMAP) is under development for JBSA and is expected to be available to the public in 2016. As part of this effort, summary documents titled “Partners in One Community” are being developed for Bexar and Guadalupe counties. These planning documents will provide valuable information for the City’s future planning efforts.
Some encroachment problems existed before the JLUS were completed, and remain as issues that still impact both military operations and training, and adjacent communities. In other cases, encroachment and compatibility issues were identified in a JLUS, but have not yet been addressed by City regulations or ordinances. Coordinated efforts are needed to revisit and address JLUS recommendations that have not yet been implemented. 
We must pay particular attention to unresolved issues that require coordination among or attention from multiple jurisdictions. As the largest city in the region we must lead regional efforts to establish cooperative agreements where there are multiple jurisdictions adjacent or near to MIAs. Memorandums of Understanding have typically been established between military bases and single jurisdictions, and in some cases, a regional jurisdiction. A more comprehensive regional approach is needed to help ensure the bases are experiencing more consistent regulations and ordinances throughout the region."

heading-title: "Economic Impact and Employment"
heading-questions: "How can the City leverage the presence of JBSA locations and personnel to enhance San Antonio’s economic performance, including employment, military spending and investment, and research and advanced training projects?"
heading-content: "The military is an important source of employment for the City of San Antonio and the broader region. Aggregating employment across these multiple locations, an estimated 132,000 jobs are directly attributed to the U.S. Department of Defense. 
That direct employment also helps generate additional indirect and induced jobs. Initial numbers from the updated study indicate that the military presence now generates approximately 212,000    jobs in the city.
The military also plays a key role in supporting a wide variety of non-military industries across San Antonio. The Department of Defense awarded $4 billion in local contracts in San Antonio in 2011, including $1.5 billion to <a href='https://www.sa2020.org/'>SA2020</a> targeted industries of aerospace, biosciences/healthcare   and information technology and cybersecurity.
The City should also explore policies, programs, and partnership opportunities to help harness and promote the synergy of intellectual and physical property in the area. There are unrealized opportunities to link military assets and training opportunities with research projects and advanced training in the higher education, medical and 	civilian sectors.
While San Antonio greatly benefits from the creation of jobs due to the military’s presence, it must also be cognizant of employment gaps present in veteran and spousal employment. Between 2010 and 2014 an estimated 5.32% of veterans aged 18-65 years were unemployed. With a growing number of veterans retiring in San Antonio action must be taken to ensure that an acceptable unemployment rate of between 4.5% and 5.5% is not exceeded. Additionally, services must be implemented to help military spouses find off base employment.  
Finally, although the city and JBSA installations actively work to maintain missions, or even attract new ones, it is prudent to plan for potential impacts that may occur if our bases are negatively affected by future base realignment or closure issues. When possible, the City should work with JBSA to consider how new or renovated building and facilities can be built with future, non-military uses in mind. While supporting current missions is always our top priority, we should take advantage of opportunities to envision the potential adaptive reuse of military installation buildings."

heading-questions: "How can the City provide enhanced housing, education, employment and healthcare services and opportunities for service members, veterans and their families?"
heading-content: "Access to affordable housing, quality education, healthcare and employment are all contributing factors to our overall quality of life and wellness. San Antonio needs to work with the military to ensure that service members, their families and veterans all have access to these opportunities and amenities outside of the military installations. The city’s military installations, service members, veterans and their families require a wide range of support and advocacy on multiple levels and from a broad range of organizations.
With approximately 84,405 retired and 211,299 military veterans in the San Antonio vicinity, long-range planning for provision of services to this aging population is vital.  We must continue to solicit and respond to veterans’ concerns and work towards remedying them. The City should initiate a study that addresses how the local healthcare community can help mitigate shortfalls in Veteran Affairs (VA) care.
The Commission on Veterans’ Affairs is an important part of this work. Its mission is to serve the City Council in an advisory capacity on legislative issues affecting the city's military population, both active and retired. The Commission serves as the community's liaison and advocates for veterans' affairs; advises the City Council on issues affecting San Antonio veterans and their families; and makes recommendations for improving services. This Commission, as well as other commissions and nonprofit organizations, help bridge the gap between the military, the City and other jurisdictions in the region. They create a venue for developing solutions that are mutually beneficial for both parties and we should support their efforts.
We should also encourage and support educational and job training programs that help veterans transition from military to civilian life. Job training and education courses should also be available for spouses who wish to learn trades outside of the home or off the base. 
As compatible development surrounding bases is identified and prescribed, San Antonio should work with the military to attract developers who specialize in creating affordable, community-focused housing.  As with development in all parts of our city, access to transportation, green spaces, parks, trails and proximate healthcare are all factors that should be considered."

  content: “For 300 years, the City of San Antonio has enjoyed a deep and long standing history of partnership with the military. That relationship, and the City’s commitment to its military community, is manifested through our Office of Military Affairs. San Antonio is one of the few cities in the nation that has integrated this permanent structure into our local government in order to: sustain and enhance the military’s missions, ensure the long-term protection of our bases; and support veterans, retirees, active duty personnel and their families.  
Established in 2007, the Office of Military Affairs is the City’s formal point of contact for issues of common concern affecting the military and the City.”
