The first phase of the project focused on project chartering, which included determining the Planning Team membership and finalizing the detailed plan area boundaries. Phase 1 also included an analysis by the Project Team to refine estimates for capture of growth in all regional centers and to determine how total projected growth for the City should be allocated into each Regional Center, and more generally to the future high capacity transit corridors as delineated in the adopted Comprehensive Plan.
