The third phase of the project focuses on working with the community and stakeholders to establish the Plan Framework. The Framework helps identify and organize key physical concepts and strategies related to: land use and urban form; focus areas, key corridors, and transformative projects; mobility and connectivity for all modes; and amenities and infrastructure planning. The Plan Framework is complemented by Housing and Economic Development Strategies and Neighborhood Profiles and Priorities sections.
