In the second Planning Team meeting, participants started to develop a vision and goals for the Template Regional Center through an exercise in which the group was presented with a large wall map of the Template Area and asked to identify and discuss assets, areas with opportunity for positive change, and challenges and themes for the Template Regional Center vision. Results of Exercise 2 were posted to the plan website and distributed to the planning team. This exercise helped inform the draft plan vision and goals statements.
