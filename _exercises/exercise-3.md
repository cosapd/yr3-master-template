The first Template Area Community Meeting was held August 23rd, 2017 at the St. Ann’s Gymnasium. Spanish interpreters were available. One of the objectives of this meeting was to develop a draft vision and goals for the Template Regional Center. Community members participated in several facilitated small group exercises. First each group used a map of the Template area to identify strengths, opportunities and challenges. The vision and goals exercise asked community members to write a statement describing how they envision the future of the Template Area. Facilitators encouraged community members to think about elements such as housing, connectivity, mobility, parks and open space, shops, restaurants, employment and other amenities. Small group’s identified common themes amongst their group’s individual vision statements. From these common themes, each group completed a summary of their ideas which was then read aloud by one spokesperson from each group to the entire audience. Examples of group summary images can be seen here. Results of Exercise 3 were posted to the plan website. These results directly informed the draft vision and goals statement.
