In the second community meeting, participants were invited to comment on the Template Draft Vision and Goals. The exercise asked participants to use colored markers to highlight (or add comments) words or statements of interest to them: Green= “Like”, Blue = “Add”, Red =”Dislike”. Results of the exercise were posted to the plan website via the Community Meeting #2 Summary. These results primarily supported the Draft Template Regional Center vision and goals.
