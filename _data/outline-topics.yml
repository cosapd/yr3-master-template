  title: "<a href='/about/'>Existing Conditions Atlas</a>"
  description:
  text: "In the analysis of the existing conditions, the Plan will map a number of topic areas, including land use, built and natural systems, districts, amenities and access, transportation and economic assets.  Each of those topics will be produced from the aggregation of existing data in a manner that's easy to understand.  Furthermore, a demographic and economic profile will be produced for the Plan area.  This profile will build upon the growth allocation findings from the SA Tomorrow Comprehensive Plan and will be refined to reflect the impact specific to the Plan area.  The findings of that analysis will lead to a review of the Areas of Opportunity within the Plan area."

  title: "Vision and Goals"
  description:
  text: "By evaluating inputs from residents, business owners and employees, as well as stakeholders and agencies active in each area, the Plan will construct a vision statement and planning goals. The vision statement is intended to capture the overall purpose of each plan and the identity of each planning area. The visions will be aligned with the overall vision for the City articulated in the Comprehensive Plan and will guide the creation of the Plan Framework.  Additionally, this will include an element of branding whereby the Plan will use Planning Team and community input to describe the future character and identity of the area.  Prior nomenclature of change, stability and transition will be addressed in a more holistic manner, while still addressing the details of economic development, housing assessments, and housing and job capture target development."
